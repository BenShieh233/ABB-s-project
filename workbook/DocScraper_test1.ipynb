ADM offers a range of ingredients, flavors, and solutions from nature to meet every animal’s needs. Principles of Consolidation ', 'The consolidated financial statements include the accounts of the Company and its subsidiaries. All significant intercompany accounts and transactions have been eliminated. The Company consolidates all entities, including variable interest entities (VIEs), in which it has a controlling financial interest. For VIEs, the Company assesses whether it is the primary beneficiary as defined under the applicable accounting standard. Investments in affiliates, including VIEs through which the Company exercises significant influence but does not control the investee and is not the primary beneficiary of the investee’s activities, are carried at cost plus equity in undistributed earnings since acquisition and are adjusted, where appropriate, for basis differences between the investment balance and the underlying net assets of the investee. The Company’s portion of the results of certain affiliates and results of certain VIEs are included using the most recent available financial statements. In each case, the financial statements are within 93 days of the Company’s year-end and are consistent from period to period.  ', 'Use of Estimates The preparation of consolidated financial statements in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP) requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect amounts reported in its consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes. Actual results could differ from those estimates. Cash Equivalents The Company considers all non-segregated, highly-liquid investments with a maturity of three months or less at the time of purchase to be cash equivalents. Segregated Cash and Investments The Company segregates certain cash, cash equivalents, and investment balances in accordance with regulatory requirements, commodity exchange requirements, and insurance arrangements. These balances represent deposits received from customers of the Company’s registered futures commission merchant and commodity brokerage services, cash margins and securities pledged to commodity exchange clearinghouses, and cash pledged as security under certain insurance arrangements. Segregated cash and investments also include restricted cash collateral for the various insurance programs of the Company’s captive insurance business. To the degree these segregated balances are comprised of cash and cash equivalents, they are considered restricted cash and cash equivalents on the statement of cash flows. Archer-Daniels-Midland Company Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements (Continued) Note 1. Summary of Significant Accounting Policies (Continued) Receivables The Company records accounts receivable at net realizable value. This value includes an allowance for estimated uncollectible accounts to reflect any loss anticipated on the accounts receivable balances including any accrued interest receivables thereon. The Company estimates uncollectible accounts by pooling receivables according to type, region, credit risk rating, and age. Each pool is assigned an expected loss co-efficient to arrive at a general reserve based on historical write-offs adjusted, as needed, for regional, economic, and other forward-looking factors. The Company minimizes credit risk due to the large and diversified nature of its worldwide customer base. ADM manages its exposure to counter-party credit risk through credit analysis and approvals, credit limits, and monitoring procedures. Long-term receivables recorded in other assets were not material to the Company’s overall receivables portfolio. The Company recorded bad debt expense in selling, general, and administrative expenses of $ 88 million, $ 32 million, and $ 47 million in the years ended December 31, 2022, 2021, and 2020, respectively. Changes to the allowance for estimated uncollectible accounts are as follows:  Year Ended December 31 2022 2021 Beginning, January 1 $ 122  $ 100  Current year provisions 88 32 Recoveries 2  5  Write-offs against allowance ( 12 ) ( 28 ) Foreign exchange translation adjustment ( 2 ) ( 1 ) Other 1  14  Ending, December 31 $ 199  $ 122  Effective January 1, 2020, the Company adopted Accounting Standards Codification (ASC) Topic 326, Financial Instruments - Credit Losses (Topic 326), and recorded a cumulative effect adjustment to retained earnings at January 1, 2020 of $ 8 million as a result of the adoption of Topic 326. Inventories Certain merchandisable agricultural commodity inventories, which include inventories acquired under deferred pricing contracts, are stated at market value. In addition, the Company values certain inventories using the first-in, first-out (FIFO) method at the lower of cost or net realizable value. Prior to January 1, 2020, the Company also valued certain of its agricultural commodity inventories using the last-in, first-out (LIFO) method at the lower of cost or net realizable value. Effective January 1, 2020, the Company changed the method of accounting for certain of its agricultural commodity inventories from the LIFO method to market value in the Ag Services and Oilseeds segment. The Company concluded that the accounting change did not have a material effect on prior periods’ financial statements and elected not to apply the change on a retrospective basis. As a result, the Company recorded a reduction in cost of products sold of $ 91 million ($ 69 million after tax, equal to $ 0.12 per diluted share) for the cumulative effect of the change in the year ended December 31, 2020 with no impact to the statement of cash flows. The change did not have a material impact on the Company’s results for the year ended December 31, 2020. If the Company had not made the accounting change, the effect of LIFO valuation on ADM’s operating results would have been an increase in cost of goods sold of $ 147 million ($ 113 million after tax, equal to $ 0.20 per diluted share) in the year ended December 31, 2020, with no impact to the consolidated statement of cash flows. Archer-Daniels-Midland Company Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements (Continued) Note 1. Summary of Significant Accounting Policies (Continued) The following table sets forth the Company’s inventories as of December 31, 2022 and 2021.  December 31, 2022 December 31, 2021  (In millions) Raw materials and supplies $ 6,975  $ 7,331  Finished goods 7,796  7,150  Total inventories $ 14,771  $ 14,481  Included in raw materials and supplies are work in process inventories which were not material as of December 31, 2022 and 2021. Fair Value Measurements The Company determines fair value based on the price that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between market participants at the measurement date. The Company uses the market approach valuation technique to measure the majority of its assets and liabilities carried at fair value. Three levels are established within the fair value hierarchy that may be used to report fair value: Level 1: Quoted prices (unadjusted) in active markets for identical assets or liabilities. Level 2: Observable inputs, including Level 1 prices that have been adjusted; quoted prices for similar assets or liabilities; quoted prices in markets that are less active than traded exchanges; and other inputs that are observable or can be substantially corroborated by observable market data. Level 3: Unobservable inputs that are supported by little or no market activity and that are a significant component of the fair value of the assets or liabilities. In evaluating the significance of fair value inputs, the Company generally classifies assets or liabilities as Level 3 when their fair value is determined using unobservable inputs that individually or when aggregated with other unobservable inputs, represent more than 10% of the fair value of the assets or liabilities. Judgment is required in evaluating both quantitative and qualitative factors in the determination of significance for purposes of fair value level classification. Level 3 amounts can include assets and liabilities whose value is determined using pricing models, discounted cash flow methodologies, or similar techniques, as well as assets and liabilities for which the determination of fair value requires significant management judgment or estimation. Based on historical experience with the Company’s suppliers and customers, the Company’s own credit risk and knowledge of current market conditions, the Company does not view nonperformance risk to be a significant input to fair value for the majority of its forward commodity purchase and sale contracts. However, in certain cases, if the Company believes the nonperformance risk to be a significant input, the Company records estimated fair value adjustments, and classifies the measurement in Level 3. In many cases, a valuation technique used to measure fair value includes inputs from multiple levels of the fair value hierarchy. The lowest level of input that is a significant component of the fair value measurement determines the placement of the entire fair value measurement in the hierarchy. The Company’s assessment of the significance of a particular input to the fair value measurement requires judgment, and may affect the classification of fair value assets and liabilities within the fair value hierarchy levels. The Company’s policy regarding the timing of transfers between levels, including both transfers into and transfers out of Level 3, is to measure and record the transfers at the end of the reporting period.  Archer-Daniels-Midland Company Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements (Continued) Note 1. Summary of Significant Accounting Policies (Continued) Derivatives The Company recognizes all of its derivative instruments as either assets or liabilities at fair value in its consolidated balance sheet. Unrealized gains are reported as other current assets and unrealized losses are reported as accrued expenses and other payables. The accounting for changes in the fair value (i.e., gains or losses) of a derivative instrument depends on whether it has been designated and qualifies as part of a hedging relationship and on the type of hedging relationship. The majority of the Company’s derivatives have not been designated as hedging instruments, and as such, changes in fair value of these derivatives are recognized in earnings immediately. For those derivative instruments that are designated and qualify as hedging instruments, the Company designates the hedging instrument, based upon the exposure being hedged, as a cash flow hedge or a net investment hedge. For derivative instruments that are designated and qualify as highly-effective cash flow hedges (i.e., hedging the exposure to variability in expected future cash flows that is attributable to a particular risk), the gain or loss on the derivative instrument is reported as a component of accumulated other comprehensive income (loss) (AOCI) and as an operating activity in the statement of cash flows and reclassified into earnings in the same line item affected by the hedged transaction and in the same period or periods during which the hedged transaction affects earnings. Hedge components excluded from the assessment of effectiveness and gains and losses related to discontinued hedges are recognized in the consolidated statement of earnings during the current period. For derivative instruments that are designated and qualify as net investment hedges, foreign exchange gains and losses related to changes in foreign currency exchange rates are deferred in AOCI until the underlying investment is divested. Cost Method Investments Cost method investments of $ 488 million and $ 297 million as of December 31, 2022 and 2021, respectively, are included in Other Assets in the Company’s consolidated balance sheets. Revaluation gains of $ 37 million, $ 49 million, and $ 23 million for the years ended December 31, 2022, 2021, and 2020, respectively, in connection with observable third-party transactions, are recorded in interest and investment income in the Company’s consolidated statements of earnings. As of December 31, 2022, the cumulative amount of upward adjustments is $ 113 million. Property, Plant, and Equipment Property, plant, and equipment are recorded at cost. Repair and maintenance costs are expensed as incurred. The Company uses the straight-line method in computing depreciation for financial reporting purposes and generally uses accelerated methods for income tax purposes. The annual provisions for depreciation have been computed principally in accordance with the following ranges of asset lives: buildings - 15 to 40 years; machinery and equipment - 3 to 40 years. The Company capitalized interest on major construction projects in progress of $ 20 million, $ 17 million, and $ 14 million for the years ended December 31, 2022, 2021, and 2020, respectively. Income Taxes The Company accounts for income taxes in accordance with the liability method. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are recorded for temporary differences between the tax basis of assets and liabilities and reported amounts in the consolidated financial statements using statutory rates in effect for the year in which the differences are expected to reverse. The effect on deferred tax assets and liabilities of a change in tax rates is recorded in the results of operations in the period that includes the enactment date under the law. Applicable accounting standards prescribe a minimum threshold a tax position is required to meet before being recognized in the consolidated financial statements. The Company recognizes in its consolidated financial statements tax positions determined more likely than not to be sustained upon examination, based on the technical merits of the position. The Company classifies interest on income tax-related balances as interest expense and classifies tax-related penalties as selling, general, and administrative expenses. Income tax effects from AOCI are released when the individual units of account are sold, terminated, or extinguished. Archer-Daniels-Midland Company Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements (Continued) Note 1. Summary of Significant Accounting Policies (Continued) Goodwill and other intangible assets Goodwill and other intangible assets deemed to have indefinite lives are not amortized but are subject to annual impairment tests. Definite-lived intangible assets, including capitalized expenses related to the Company’s 1ADM program such as third-party configuration costs and internal labor, are amortized over their estimated useful lives of 1 to 50 years and are reviewed for impairment whenever there are indicators that the carrying value of the assets may not be fully recoverable. The Company’s accounting policy is to evaluate goodwill and other intangible assets with indefinite lives for impairment on October 1 of each fiscal year or whenever there are indicators that the carrying value of the assets may not be fully recoverable. The Company recorded impairment charges totaling $ 2 million related to customer lists, $ 52 million related to goodwill and other intangibles, and $ 26 million related to customer lists during the years ended December 31, 2022, 2021, and 2020, respectively (see Note 9 for additional information). Asset Abandonments and Write-Downs The Company evaluates long-lived assets for impairment whenever indicators of impairment exist. In addition, assets are written down to fair value after consideration of the Company’s ability to utilize the assets for their intended purpose, employ the assets in alternative uses, or sell the assets to recover the carrying value. Fair value is generally based on discounted cash flow analysis which relies on management’s estimate of market participant assumptions or estimated selling price for assets considered held for sale (a Level 3 measurement under applicable accounting standards). During 2022 and 2021, the Company temporarily idled certain assets which were not material. During 2020, the Company temporarily idled certain of its corn processing assets where ethanol is produced and performed a quantitative impairment assessment of those assets, resulting in no impairment charges. The Company restarted the 2020 idled facilities in April 2021. During the years ended December 31, 2022, 2021, and 2020, asset abandonment and impairment charges were $ 35 million, $ 73 million, and $ 28 million, respectively. Payables to Brokerage Customers Payables to brokerage customers represent the total of customer accounts at the Company’s futures commission merchant with credit or positive balances. Customer accounts are used primarily in connection with commodity transactions and include gains and losses on open commodity trades as well as securities and other deposits made for margins or other purposes as required by the Company or the exchange-clearing organizations or counterparties. Payables to brokerage customers have a corresponding balance in segregated cash and investments and customer omnibus receivable in other current assets. Revenues The Company follows a policy of recognizing revenue at a single point in time when it satisfies its performance obligation by transferring control over a product or service to a customer. For transportation service contracts, the Company recognizes revenue over time as the mode of transportation moves towards its destination in accordance with the transfer of control guidance of ASC Topic 606, Revenue from Contracts with Customers (“Topic 606”). For physically settled derivative sales contracts that are outside the scope of Topic 606, the Company recognizes revenue when control of the inventory is transferred within the meaning of Topic 606 as required by ASC 610-20, Gains and Losses from the Derecognition of Nonfinancial Assets (“Topic 610-20”). Stock Compensation The Company recognizes expense for its stock compensation based on the fair value of the awards that are granted. The Company’s stock compensation plans provide for the granting of restricted stock, restricted stock units, performance stock units, and stock options. The fair values of stock options and performance stock units are estimated at the date of grant using the Black-Scholes option valuation model and a lattice valuation model, respectively. These valuation models require the input of subjective assumptions. Measured compensation cost, net of forfeitures, is recognized ratably over the vesting period of the related stock compensation award. Archer-Daniels-Midland Company Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements (Continued) Note 1. Summary of Significant Accounting Policies (Continued) Research and Development Costs associated with research and development are expensed as incurred and recorded within selling, general, and administrative expenses. Such costs incurred, net of expenditures subsequently reimbursed by government grants, were $ 216 million, $ 171 million, and $ 160 million for the years ended December 31, 2022, 2021, and 2020, respectively. Per Share Data Basic earnings per common share are determined by dividing net earnings attributable to controlling interests by the weighted average number of common shares outstanding. In computing diluted earnings per share, average number of common shares outstanding is increased by common stock options outstanding with exercise prices lower than the average market price of common shares using the treasury share method. Business Combinations ', 'The Company’s acquisitions are accounted for in accordance with ASC Topic 805, Business Combinations, as amended . The consideration transferred is allocated to various assets acquired and liabilities assumed at their estimated fair values as of the acquisition date with the residual allocated to goodwill. Fair values allocated to assets acquired and liabilities assumed in business combinations require management to make significant judgments, estimates, and assumptions, especially with respect to intangible assets. Management makes estimates of fair values based upon assumptions it believes to be reasonable. These estimates are based upon historical experience and information obtained from the management of the acquired companies and are inherently uncertain. The estimated fair values related to intangible assets primarily consist of customer relationships, trademarks, and developed technology which are determined primarily using discounted cash flow models. Estimates in the discounted cash flow models include, but are not limited to, certain assumptions that form the basis of the forecasted results (e.g. revenue growth rates, customer attrition rates, and royalty rates). These significant assumptions are forward looking and could be affected by future economic and market conditions. During the measurement period, which may take up to one year from the acquisition date, adjustments due to changes in the estimated fair value of assets acquired and liabilities assumed may be recorded as adjustments to the consideration transferred and the related allocations. Upon the conclusion of the measurement period or the final determination of the values of assets acquired and liabilities assumed, whichever comes first, any such adjustments are charged to the consolidated statements of earnings. ', 'Redeemable Noncontrolling Interest The Company accounts for any redeemable noncontrolling interest in temporary equity - redeemable noncontrolling interest at redemption value with periodic changes recorded in retained earnings. Operations in Ukraine and Russia ADM employs approximately 640 people in Ukraine and operates an oilseeds crushing plant, a grain port terminal, inland and river silos, and a trading office. Most of the facilities have been temporarily idled since February 24, 2022, some of which were brought back online during the quarter ended September 30, 2022, due in part to the opening of the Black Sea grain export corridor. The Company’s footprint in Russia is limited to operations related to the production and transport of essential food commodities and ingredients. As a result of the ongoing conflict in Ukraine, the Company reviewed the valuation of its assets and recorded immaterial charges in the year ended December 31, 2022 related to receivables and inventories. As of December 31, 2022, ADM concluded that 1) receivables, net of allowances, are deemed collectible; and 2) commodity inventories are valued appropriately. The temporarily idled property, plant, and equipment, which is immaterial, are not considered impaired. The Company also evaluated the impact of Russia’s recent announcement of its purported annexation of four Ukrainian regions on the valuation of ADM’s assets in those regions and concluded that the assets are appropriately valued. As the conflict in Ukraine evolves, the Company will continue to review the valuation of these assets and make any required adjustments, which are not expected to be material to the Company’s consolidated financial statements. Archer-Daniels-Midland Company Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements (Continued) Note 1. Summary of Significant Accounting Policies (Continued) Pending Accounting Standards Through December 31, 2024, the Company has the option to adopt the amended guidance of ASC Topic 848, Reference Rate Reform , which provides optional expedients and exceptions for applying GAAP to contracts, hedging relationships, and other transactions affected by the reference rate reform if certain criteria are met. The amendments apply only to contracts, hedging relationships, and other transactions that reference LIBOR or another reference rate expected to be discontinued because of the reference rate reform. The expedients and exceptions provided by the amended guidance do not apply to contract modifications made and hedging relationships entered into or evaluated after December 31, 2024, except for hedging relationships existing as of December 31, 2024, that an entity has elected certain optional expedients for and that are retained through the end of the hedging relationship. The Company plans to adopt the expedients and exceptions provided by the amended guidance before the December 31, 2024 expiry date and does not expect the adoption of the amended guidance to have an impact on the consolidated financial statements. Effective January 1, 2023, the Company will be required to adopt the amended guidance of ASC Topic 805, Business Combinations , which improves comparability for both the recognition and measurement of acquired revenue contracts with customers at the date of and after a business combination. The amended guidance requires an entity (acquirer) to recognize and measure contract assets and contract liabilities acquired in a business combination in accordance with Topic 606. The Company does not expect the adoption of this amended guidance to have a significant impact on its consolidated financial statements. Effective January 1, 2023, the Company will be required to adopt the amended guidance of ASC Subtopic 405-50, Liabilities - Supplier Finance Programs , which enhances the transparency of supplier finance programs. The amended guidance requires an entity (buyer) in a supplier finance program to disclose sufficient information about the program to allow a user of financial statements to understand the program’s nature, activity during the period, changes from period to period, and potential magnitude. The adoption of this amended guidance will require the Company to provide disclosures about its supplier finance programs, if material, but is not expected to have an impact on its consolidated financial statements. Note 2. Revenues Revenue Recognition The Company principally generates revenue from merchandising and transporting agricultural commodities, and manufacturing products for use in food, beverages, feed, energy, and industrial applications, and ingredients and solutions for human and animal nutrition. Revenue is measured based on the consideration specified in the contract with a customer. The Company follows a policy of recognizing revenue at a single point in time when it satisfies its performance obligation by transferring control over a product or service to a customer. The majority of the Company’s contracts with customers have one performance obligation and a contract duration of one year or less. The Company applies the practical expedient in paragraph 10-50-14 of Topic 606 and does not disclose information about remaining performance obligations that have original expected durations of one year or less. For transportation service contracts, the Company recognizes revenue over time as the mode of transportation moves towards its destination in accordance with the transfer of control guidance of Topic 606. The Company recognized revenue from transportation service contracts of $ 818 million, $ 606 million, and $ 423 million for the years ended December 31, 2022, 2021, and 2020, respectively. For physically settled derivative sales contracts that are outside the scope of Topic 606, the Company recognizes revenue when control of the inventory is transferred within the meaning of Topic 606 as required by ASC 610-20. Shipping and Handling Costs Shipping and handling costs related to contracts with customers for the sale of goods are accounted for as a fulfillment activity and are included in cost of products sold. Accordingly, amounts billed to customers for such costs are included as a component of revenues. Archer-Daniels-Midland Company Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements (Continued) Note 2. Revenues (Continued) Taxes Collected from Customers and Remitted to Governmental Authorities The Company does not include taxes assessed by governmental authorities that are (i) imposed on and concurrent with a specific revenue-producing transaction and (ii) collected from customers, in the measurement of transactions prices or as a component of revenues and cost of products sold. Contract Liabilities Contract liabilities relate to advance payments from customers for goods and services that the Company has yet to provide. Contract liabilities of $ 694 million and $ 581 million as of December 31, 2022 and 2021, respectively, were recorded in accrued expenses and other payables in the consolidated balance sheet. Contract liabilities recognized as revenues for the years ended December 31, 2022 and 2021 were $ 581 million and $ 626 million, respectively. Disaggregation of Revenues The following tables present revenue disaggregated by timing of recognition and major product lines for the years ended December 31, 2022, 2021, and 2020.

Archer-Daniels-Midland Company Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements (Continued) Note 2. Revenues (Continued) Ag Services and Oilseeds The Ag Services and Oilseeds segment generates revenue from the sale of commodities, from service fees for the transportation of goods, from the sale of products manufactured in its global processing facilities, and from its structured trade finance activities. Revenue is measured based on the consideration specified in the contract. Revenue is recognized when a performance obligation is satisfied by transferring control over a product or providing service to a customer. For transportation service contracts, the Company recognizes revenue over time as the mode of transportation moves towards its destination in accordance with the transfer of control guidance of Topic 606. The amount of revenue recognized follows the contractually specified price which may include freight or other contractually specified cost components. For physically settled derivative sales contracts that are outside the scope of Topic 606, the Company recognizes revenue when control of the inventory is transferred within the meaning of Topic 606 as required by Topic 610-20. The Company engages in various structured trade finance activities to leverage its global trade flows whereby the Company obtains letters of credit (LCs) to guarantee payments on both global purchases and sales of grain. LCs guaranteeing payment on grain sales are sold on a non-recourse basis with no continuing involvement. The Company earns returns from the difference in interest rates between the LCs that guarantee payment on the underlying purchases and sales of grain given the differing risk profiles of the underlying transactions. The net return related to structured trade finance activities is included in revenue and is not significant for the years ended December 31, 2022, 2021, and 2020. Carbohydrate Solutions The Carbohydrate Solutions segment generates revenue from the sale of products manufactured at the Company’s global corn and wheat milling facilities around the world. Revenue is recognized when control over products is transferred to the customer. Products are shipped to customers from the Company’s various facilities and from its network of storage terminals. The amount of revenue recognized is based on the consideration specified in the contract which could include freight and other costs depending on the specific shipping terms of each contract. For physically settled derivative sales contracts that are outside the scope of Topic 606, the Company recognizes revenue when control of the inventory is transferred within the meaning of Topic 606 as required by Topic 610-20. Nutrition The Nutrition segment sells ingredients and solutions including plant-based proteins, natural flavors, flavor systems, natural colors, emulsifiers, soluble fiber, polyols, hydrocolloids, probiotics, prebiotics, enzymes, botanical extracts, edible beans, formula feeds, animal health and nutrition products, pet food and treats, and other specialty food and feed ingredients. Revenue is recognized when control over products is transferred to the customer. The amount of revenue recognized follows the contracted price or the mutually agreed price of the product. Freight and shipping are recognized as a component of revenue at the same time control transfers to the customer. Other Business Other Business includes the Company’s futures commission business whose primary sources of revenue are commissions and brokerage income generated from executing orders and clearing futures contracts and options on futures contracts on behalf of its customers. Commissions and brokerage revenue are recognized on the date the transaction is executed. Other Business also includes the Company’s captive insurance business which generates third party revenue through its proportionate share of premiums from third-party reinsurance pools. Reinsurance premiums are recognized on a straight-line basis over the period underlying the policy. Archer-Daniels-Midland Company Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements (Continued) Note 3. Acquisitions ', 'Fiscal year 2022 acquisitions ', 'During the year ended December 31, 2022, the Company acquired Kansas Protein Foods LLC for cash consideration of $ 23 million.

Archer-Daniels-Midland Company Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements (Continued) Note 4. Fair Value Measurements The following tables set forth, by level, the Company’s assets and liabilities that were accounted for at fair value on a recurring basis as of December 31, 2022 and 2021.

Market valuations for the Company’s inventories are adjusted for location and quality (basis) because the exchange-quoted prices represent contracts that have standardized terms for commodity, quantity, future delivery period, delivery location, and commodity quality or grade. The basis adjustments are generally determined using inputs from competitor and broker quotations or market transactions and are considered observable. Basis adjustments are impacted by specific local supply and demand characteristics at each facility and the overall market. Factors such as substitute products, weather, fuel costs, contract terms, and futures prices also impact the movement of these basis adjustments. In some cases, the basis adjustments are unobservable because they are supported by little to no market activity. When unobservable inputs have a significant impact (more than 10%) on the measurement of fair value, the inventory is classified in Level 3. Changes in the fair value of inventories and inventory-related payables are recognized in the consolidated statements of earnings as a component of cost of products sold. Archer-Daniels-Midland Company Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements (Continued)  Note 4. Fair Value Measurements (Continued) Derivative contracts include exchange-traded commodity futures and options contracts, forward commodity purchase and sale contracts, and OTC instruments related primarily to agricultural commodities, energy, interest rates, and foreign currencies. Exchange-traded futures and options contracts are valued based on unadjusted quoted prices in active markets and are classified in Level 1. The majority of the Company’s exchange-traded futures and options contracts are cash-settled on a daily basis and, therefore, are not included in these tables. Fair value for forward commodity purchase and sale contracts is estimated based on exchange-quoted prices adjusted for differences in local markets. Market valuations for the Company’s forward commodity purchase and sale contracts are adjusted for location (basis) because the exchange-quoted prices represent contracts that have standardized terms for commodity, quantity, future delivery period, delivery location, and commodity quality or grade. The basis adjustments are generally determined using inputs from competitor and broker quotations or market transactions and are considered observable. Basis adjustments are impacted by specific local supply and demand characteristics at each facility and the overall market. Factors such as substitute products, weather, fuel costs, contract terms, and futures prices also impact the movement of these basis adjustments. In some cases, the basis adjustments are unobservable because they are supported by little to no market activity. When observable inputs are available for substantially the full term of the contract, it is classified in Level 2. When unobservable inputs have a significant impact (more than 10%) on the measurement of fair value, the contract is classified in Level 3. Except for certain derivatives designated as cash flow hedges, changes in the fair value of commodity-related derivatives are recognized in the consolidated statements of earnings as a component of cost of products sold. Changes in the fair value of foreign currency-related derivatives are recognized in the consolidated statements of earnings as a component of revenues, cost of products sold, and other (income) expense - net, depending upon the purpose of the contract. The changes in the fair value of derivatives designated as effective cash flow hedges are recognized in the consolidated balance sheets as a component of AOCI until the hedged items are recorded in earnings or it is probable the hedged transaction will no longer occur. The Company’s cash equivalents are comprised of money market funds valued using quoted market prices and are classified as Level 1. The Company’s segregated investments are comprised of U.S. Treasury securities. U.S. Treasury securities are valued using quoted market prices and are classified in Level 1. The debt conversion option is the equity linked embedded derivative related to the exchangeable bonds described in Note 10. The fair value of the embedded derivative is included in long-term debt, with changes in fair value recognized as interest, and is valued with the assistance of a third-party pricing service (a level 3 measurement). Archer-Daniels-Midland Company Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements (Continued)  Note 4. Fair Value Measurements (Continued) The following tables present a rollforward of the activity of all assets and liabilities measured at fair value on a recurring basis using significant unobservable inputs (Level 3) during the years ended December 31, 2022 and 2021.   Level 3 Fair Value Assets Measurements at December 31, 2022 Inventories Carried at Market Commodity Derivative Contracts Gains Total  (In millions) Balance, December 31, 2021 $ 3,004  $ 460  $ 3,464  Total increase (decrease) in net realized/unrealized gains included in cost of products sold 867  1,648  2,515  Purchases 49,735  —  49,735  Sales ( 50,414 ) —  ( 50,414 ) Settlements —  ( 1,672 ) ( 1,672 ) Transfers into Level 3 1,088  400  1,488  Transfers out of Level 3 ( 1,520 ) ( 295 ) ( 1,815 ) Ending balance, December 31, 2022 (1) $ 2,760  $ 541  $ 3,301  (1) Includes increase in unrealized gains of $ 2.7 billion relating to Level 3 assets still held at December 31, 2022.

Level 3 Fair Value Liabilities Measurements at December 31, 2021 Inventory- related Payables Commodity Derivative Contracts Losses Debt Conversion Option Total  (In millions) Balance, December 31, 2020 $ 11  $ 918  $ 34  $ 963  Total increase (decrease) in net realized/unrealized losses included in cost of products sold and interest expense 2  1,992  ( 19 ) 1,975  Purchases 123  —  —  123  Sales ( 30 ) —  — ( 30 ) Settlements —  ( 2,191 ) — ( 2,191 ) Transfers into Level 3 —  324  — 324  Transfers out of Level 3 —  ( 228 ) — ( 228 ) Ending balance, December 31, 2021 (1) $ 106  $ 815  $ 15  $ 936  (1) Includes increase in unrealized losses of $ 2.0 billion relating to Level 3 liabilities still held at December 31, 2021. Transfers into Level 3 of assets and liabilities previously classified in Level 2 were due to the relative value of unobservable inputs to the total fair value measurement of certain products and derivative contracts rising above the 10% threshold. Transfers out of Level 3 were primarily due to the relative value of unobservable inputs to the total fair value measurement of certain products and derivative contracts falling below the 10% threshold and thus permitting reclassification to Level 2. Archer-Daniels-Midland Company Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements (Continued)  Note 4. Fair Value Measurements (Continued) In some cases, the price components that result in differences between exchange-traded prices and local prices for inventories and commodity purchase and sale contracts are observable based upon available quotations for these pricing components, and in some cases, the differences are unobservable. These price components primarily include transportation costs and other adjustments required due to location, quality, or other contract terms. In the table below, these other adjustments are referred to as basis. The following table sets forth the weighted average percentage of the unobservable price components included in the Company’s Level 3 valuations as of December 31, 2022 and 2021. The Company’s Level 3 measurements may include basis only, transportation cost only, or both price components. As an example, for Level 3 inventories with basis, the unobservable component as of December 31, 2022 is a weighted average 19.4 % of the total price for assets and 15.2 % of the total price for liabilities.   Weighted Average % of Total Price  December 31, 2022 December 31, 2021 Component Type Assets Liabilities Assets Liabilities Inventories and Related Payables     Basis 19.4 % 15.2 % 28.7 % 13.1 % Transportation cost 10.5 % — % 13.0 % — % Commodity Derivative Contracts     Basis 22.7 % 26.5 % 30.0 % 27.1 % Transportation cost 13.5 % 3.7 % 8.1 % 0.7 % In certain of the Company’s principal markets, the Company relies on price quotes from third parties to value its inventories and physical commodity purchase and sale contracts. These price quotes are generally not further adjusted by the Company in determining the applicable market price. In some cases, availability of third-party quotes is limited to only one or two independent sources. In these situations, absent other corroborating evidence, the Company considers these price quotes as 100% unobservable and, therefore, the fair value of these items is reported in Level 3. Note 5. Derivative Instruments & Hedging Activities Derivatives Not Designated as Hedging Instruments The majority of the Company’s derivative instruments have not been designated as hedging instruments. The Company uses exchange-traded futures and exchange-traded and OTC options contracts to manage its net position of merchandisable agricultural product inventories and forward cash purchase and sales contracts to reduce price risk caused by market fluctuations in agricultural commodities and foreign currencies. The Company also uses exchange-traded futures and exchange-traded and OTC options contracts as components of merchandising strategies designed to enhance margins. The results of these strategies can be significantly impacted by factors such as the correlation between the value of exchange-traded commodities futures contracts and the value of the underlying commodities, counterparty contract defaults, and volatility of freight markets. Derivatives, including exchange traded contracts and forward commodity purchase or sale contracts, and inventories of certain merchandisable agricultural products, which include amounts acquired under deferred pricing contracts, are stated at fair value or market value. Inventory is not a derivative and therefore fair values of and changes in fair values of inventories are not included in the tables below.

Derivative Instruments & Hedging Activities (Continued) Changes in the market value of inventories of certain merchandisable agricultural commodities, inventory-related payables, forward cash purchase and sales contracts, exchange-traded futures, and exchange-traded and OTC options contracts are recognized in earnings immediately as a component of cost of products sold. Changes in the fair value of foreign currency-related derivatives are recognized in the consolidated statements of earnings as a component of revenues, cost of products sold, and other (income) expense - net depending on the purpose of the contract. Derivatives Designated as Cash Flow or Net Investment Hedging Instruments The Company had certain derivatives designated as cash flow and net investment hedges as of December 31, 2022 and 2021. For derivative instruments that are designated and qualify as highly-effective cash flow hedges (i.e., hedging the exposure to variability in expected future cash flow that is attributable to a particular risk), the gain or loss on the derivative instrument is reported as a component of AOCI and as an operating activity in the statement of cash flows and reclassified into earnings in the same line item affected by the hedged transaction and in the same period or periods during which the hedged transaction affects earnings. Hedge components excluded from the assessment of effectiveness and gains and losses related to discontinued hedges are recognized in the consolidated statement of earnings during the current period. Commodity Contracts For each of the hedge programs described below, the derivatives are designated as cash flow hedges. The changes in the market value of such derivative contracts have historically been, and are expected to continue to be, highly effective at offsetting changes in price movements of the hedged item. Once the hedged item is recognized in earnings, the gains and losses arising from the hedge are reclassified from AOCI to either revenues or cost of products sold, as applicable. The Company uses futures or options contracts to hedge the purchase price of anticipated volumes of corn to be purchased and processed in a future month. The objective of this hedging program is to reduce the variability of cash flows associated with the Company’s forecasted purchases of corn. The Company’s corn processing plants normally grind approximately 65 million bushels per month. During the past 12 months, the Company hedged between 17 % and 33 % of its monthly grind. At December 31, 2022, the Company had designated hedges representing between 14 % to 28 % of its anticipated monthly grind of corn for the next 12 months. The Company, from time to time, also uses futures, options, and swaps to hedge the sales price of certain ethanol sales contracts. The Company has established hedging programs for ethanol sales contracts that are indexed to unleaded gasoline prices and to various exchange-traded ethanol contracts. The objective of these hedging programs is to reduce the variability of cash flows associated with the Company’s sales of ethanol. During the past 12 months and as of December 31, 2022, the Company had no hedges related to ethanol sales. The Company uses futures and options contracts to hedge the purchase price of anticipated volumes of soybeans to be purchased and processed in a future month for certain of its U.S. soybean crush facilities, subject to certain program limits. The Company also uses futures or options contracts to hedge the sales prices of anticipated soybean meal and soybean oil sales proportionate to the soybean crushing process at these facilities, subject to certain program limits. During the past 12 months, the Company hedged between 85 % and 100 % of the anticipated monthly soybean crush for soybean purchases and soybean meal and oil sales at the designated facilities. At December 31, 2022, the Company had designated hedges representing between 0 % and 100 % of the anticipated monthly soybean crush for soybean purchases and soybean meal and oil sales at the designated facilities over the next 12 months. The Company uses futures and OTC swaps to hedge the purchase price of anticipated volumes of natural gas consumption in a future month for certain of its facilities in North America and Europe, subject to certain program limits. During the past 12 months, the Company hedged between 73 % and 93 % of the anticipated monthly natural gas consumption at the designated facilities. At December 31, 2022, the Company had designated hedges representing between 53 % and 83 % of the anticipated monthly natural gas consumption over the next 12 months. Archer-Daniels-Midland Company Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements (Continued) Note 5. Derivative Instruments & Hedging Activities (Continued) As of December 31, 2022 and 2021, the Company had after-tax losses of $ 17 million and after-tax gains of $ 161 million in AOCI, respectively, related to gains and losses from these programs. The Company expects to recognize $ 17 million of the 2022 after-tax losses in its consolidated statement of earnings during the next 12 months. Interest Rate Contracts The Company’s structured trade finance programs use interest rate swaps designated as cash flow hedges to hedge the forecasted interest payments on certain letters of credit from banks. The terms of the interest rate swaps match the terms of the forecasted interest payments. The deferred gains and losses are recognized in revenues over the period in which the related interest payments are paid to the banks. The amounts are recorded in revenues as the related results are also recorded in revenues. The Company had interest rate swaps maturing on various dates with aggregate notional amount of $ 1.0 billion as of December 31, 2021 and none as of December 31, 2022. The Company also uses swap locks designated as cash flow hedges to hedge the changes in the forecasted interest payments due to changes in the benchmark rate leading up to future bond issuance dates. The terms of the swap locks match the terms of the forecasted interest payments. The deferred gains and losses will be recognized in interest expense over the period in which the related interest payments will be paid. As of December 31, 2022 and 2021, the Company executed swap locks maturing on various dates with an aggregate notional amount of $ 400 million. As of December 31, 2022 and 2021, the Company had after-tax gains of $ 82 million and $ 35 million in AOCI, respectively, related to the interest rate swaps and swap locks. The Company expects to recognize amounts deferred in AOCI in its consolidated statement of earnings during the life of the instruments. Foreign Currency Contracts The Company uses cross-currency swaps and foreign exchange forwards designated as net investment hedges to protect the Company’s investment in a foreign subsidiary against changes in foreign currency exchange rates. The Company executed USD-fixed to Euro-fixed cross-currency swaps with an aggregate notional amount of $ 0.8 billion and $ 1.2 billion as of December 31, 2022 and 2021, respectively, and foreign exchange forwards with an aggregate notional amount of $ 2.5 billion and $ 2.6 billion as of December 31, 2022 and 2021, respectively. Amounts excluded from the assessment of hedge effectiveness are immaterial for all periods presented. As of December 31, 2022 and 2021, the Company had after-tax gains of $ 79 million and after-tax losses of $ 44 million in AOCI, respectively, related to foreign exchange gains and losses from net investment hedge transactions. The amount is deferred in AOCI until the underlying investment is divested.

Stock Compensation The Company’s employee stock compensation plans provide for the granting of options to employees to purchase common stock of the Company pursuant to the Company’s 2020 Incentive Compensation Plan. These options are issued at market value on the date of grant, vest incrementally over one year to five years , and expire ten years after the date of grant. The fair value of each option grant is estimated as of the date of grant using the Black-Scholes single option pricing model. The volatility assumption used in the Black-Scholes single option pricing model is based on the historical volatility of the Company’s stock. The volatility of the Company’s stock was calculated based upon the monthly closing price of the Company’s stock for the period immediately prior to the date of grant corresponding to the average expected life of the grant. The average expected life represents the period of time that option grants are expected to be outstanding. The risk-free rate is based on the rate of U.S. Treasury zero-coupon issues with a remaining term equal to the expected life of option grants. No options were granted in 2022, 2021, and 2020.

In 2022, the awards for PSUs are made in common stock units and vest at the end of a vesting period of three years subject to the attainment of certain future service and performance criteria based on the Company’s adjusted return on invested capital (ROIC) and adjusted earnings per share (EPS) with a modifier for gender parity and greenhouse gas emissions. During the years ended December 31, 2022, 2021, and 2020, 2.3 million, 2.7 million, and 2.7 million common stock or stock units, respectively, were granted as Restricted Stock Awards and PSUs. At December 31, 2022, there were 14.7 million shares available for future grants pursuant to the 2020 plan. The fair value of Restricted Stock Awards is determined based on the market value of the Company’s shares on the grant date. In 2022, the fair value of PSUs issued was based on the weighted-average values of adjusted ROIC and adjusted EPS determined based on the market value of the Company’s shares on the grant date. In 2021 and 2020, the fair value of PSUs issued was based on the weighted-average values of adjusted ROIC and compound average growth rate of Nutrition’s segment operating profit determined based on the market value of the Company’s shares on the grant date. The weighted-average grant-date fair values of awards granted during the years ended December 31, 2022, 2021, and 2020 were $ 70.13 , $ 53.28 , and $ 45.59 , respectively. Archer-Daniels-Midland Company Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements (Continued) Note 11. Stock Compensation (Continued) A summary of Restricted Stock Awards and PSUs activity during 2022 is presented below:  Restricted Stock Awards and PSUs Weighted Average Grant-Date Fair Value  (In thousands, except per share amounts) Non-vested at December 31, 2021 7,135  $ 47.27 Granted 2,267  70.13 Vested ( 2,794 ) 42.02 Forfeited ( 200 ) 63.15 Non-vested at December 31, 2022 6,408  $ 57.22 At December 31, 2022, there was $ 95 million of total unrecognized compensation expense related to Restricted Stock Awards and PSUs. Amounts to be recognized as compensation expense during the next three years are $ 61 million, $ 31 million, and $ 3 million, respectively. The total grant-date fair value of Restricted Stock Awards that vested during the year ended December 31, 2022 was $ 117 million. Compensation expense for option grants, Restricted Stock Awards, and PSUs granted to employees is generally recognized on a straight-line basis during the service period of the respective grant. Certain of the Company’s option grants, Restricted Stock Awards, and PSUs continue to vest upon the recipient’s retirement from the Company and compensation expense related to option grants and Restricted Stock Awards granted to retirement-eligible employees is recognized in earnings on the date of grant. Compensation expense for PSUs is based on the probability of meeting the performance criteria. The Company recognizes forfeitures as they occur. Total compensation expense for option grants, Restricted Stock Awards, and PSUs recognized during the years ended December 31, 2022, 2021, and 2020 was $ 147 million, $ 161 million, and $ 151 million, respectively. Changes in incentive compensation expense are primarily caused by the level of attainment of the PSU performance criteria described above. Note 12. Other (Income) Expense – Net The following table sets forth the items in other (income) expense:  (In millions) Year Ended December 31  2022 2021 2020 Gains on sale of assets $ ( 78 ) $ ( 100 ) $ ( 138 ) Pension settlement —  83  —  Other – net ( 280 ) ( 77 ) ( 117 )  $ ( 358 ) $ ( 94 ) $ ( 255 ) Individually significant items included in the table above are: Gains on sale of assets for the year ended December 31, 2022 consisted of gains on sales of certain assets and disposals of individually insignificant assets in the ordinary course of business. Gains on sale of assets for the year ended December 31, 2021 consisted of gains on the sale of the Company’s ethanol production complex in Peoria, Illinois of $ 22 million, the sale of certain other assets, and disposals of individually insignificant assets in the ordinary course of business. Gains on sale of assets for the year ended December 31, 2020 included a gain on the sale of a portion of the Company’s shares in Wilmar and net gains on the sale of certain other assets and disposals of individually insignificant assets in the ordinary course of business. Archer-Daniels-Midland Company Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements (Continued) Note 12. Other (Income) Expense – Net (Continued) Pension settlement for the year ended December 31, 2021 was related to the purchase of group annuity contracts that irrevocably transferred the future benefit obligations and annuity administration for certain salaried and hourly retirees and terminated vested participants under the Company’s ADM Retirement Plan and ADM Pension Plan for Hourly-Wage Employees to independent third parties. Other - net for the year ended December 31, 2022 included a legal recovery related to the 2019 and 2020 closure of the Company’s Reserve, Louisiana, export facility of $ 110 million, net foreign exchange gains of $ 105 million, a $ 50 million one-time payment from the USDA Biofuel Producer Recovery Program, and the non-service components of net pension benefit income of $ 25 million, partially offset by other net expense. Other - net for the year ended December 31, 2021 included the non-service components of net pension benefit income of $ 16 million, net foreign exchange gains of $ 24 million, and other income. Other - net for the year ended December 31, 2020 included the non-service components of net pension benefit income of $ 33 million, foreign exchange gains, and other income. Note 13.

Archer-Daniels-Midland Company Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements (Continued) Note 13. Income Taxes (Continued) Reconciliation of the statutory federal income tax rate to the Company’s effective income tax rate on earnings is as follows:  Year Ended December 31  2022 2021 2020 Statutory rate 21.0  % 21.0  % 21.0  % State income taxes, net of federal tax benefit 1.4  1.5  ( 0.3 ) Foreign earnings taxed at rates other than the U.S. statutory rate ( 3.8 ) ( 2.8 ) ( 2.3 ) Foreign currency effects/remeasurement 0.6  —  ( 1.1 ) Income tax adjustment to filed returns ( 0.1 ) 0.7  ( 0.4 ) Tax benefit on U.S. biodiesel credits ( 1.2 ) ( 1.9 ) ( 3.3 ) Tax benefit on U.S. railroad credits ( 1.2 ) ( 2.0 ) ( 8.0 ) U.S. tax on foreign earnings 0.2  —  0.6  Valuation allowances —  0.7  0.2  Other ( 0.3 ) 0.2  ( 1.0 ) Effective income tax rate 16.6  % 17.4  % 5.4  % The effective tax rate for 2022 was impacted by the geographic mix of earnings and discrete tax items. The effective tax rates for 2021 and 2020 were impacted by the geographic mix of earnings and U.S. tax credits, including the biodiesel tax credit and the railroad maintenance tax credit. ADM’s operations in foreign jurisdictions accounted for 48 %, 35 %, and 77 % of the Company’s total pre-tax earnings in fiscal years 2022, 2021, and 2020, respectively. The foreign rate differential was primarily due to lower tax rates applicable to the income earned from the Company’s operations in Switzerland, Asia, and the Caribbean. On August 16, 2022, the U.S. government enacted the Inflation Reduction Act of 2022 (“Inflation Act”), which includes, among other provisions, changes to the U.S. corporate income tax system, including a 15 % minimum tax based on “adjusted financial statement income,” and a one percent excise tax on net repurchases of stock for tax years beginning after December 31, 2022. While the Inflation Act has no immediate impact and is not expected to have a material adverse effect on ADM’s results of operations going forward, the Company will continue to evaluate its impact as further information becomes available. Undistributed earnings of the Company’s foreign subsidiaries and corporate joint ventures were approximately $ 15.5 billion at December 31, 2022. Because these undistributed earnings continue to be indefinitely reinvested in foreign operations, no income taxes, other than the transition tax, the U.S. tax on undistributed Subpart F, and the minimum tax on Global Intangible Low Taxed Income (GILTI), have been provided after the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act (the “Act”) was enacted on December 22, 2017. It is not practicable to determine the amount of unrecognized deferred tax liability related to any remaining undistributed earnings of foreign subsidiaries and corporate joint ventures not subject to the transition tax. The Company has elected to pay the one-time transition tax on accumulated foreign earnings over eight years. As of December 31, 2022, the Company’s remaining transition tax liability was $ 122 million, which will be paid in installments through 2025. The Company incurred U.S. taxable income of $ 684 million, $ 244 million, and $ 259 million related to GILTI and deducted $ 67 million, $ 87 million, and $ 12 million related to FDII in fiscal years 2022, 2021, and 2020 respectively. The Company made an accounting policy election to treat GILTI as a period cost. The Company has recorded and will continue to record the impact of tax reform items as U.S. tax authorities issue Treasury Regulations and other guidance addressing tax reform-related changes. The additional guidance, along with the potential for additional global tax legislation changes, may affect significant deductions and income inclusions and could have a material adverse effect on the Company’s net income or cash flow. Archer-Daniels-Midland Company Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements (Continued) Note 13. Income Taxes (Continued) The Company had $ 496 million and $ 465 million of tax assets related to net operating loss carryforwards of certain international subsidiaries at December 31, 2022 and 2021, respectively. As of December 31, 2022, approximately $ 399 million of these assets have no expiration date, and the remaining $ 97 million expire at various times through fiscal 2032. The annual usage of certain of these assets is limited to a percentage of taxable income of the respective foreign subsidiary for the year. The Company has recorded a valuation allowance of $ 142 million and $ 200 million against these tax assets at December 31, 2022 and 2021, respectively, due to the uncertainty of their realization. The Company had $ 42 million and $ 74 million of tax assets related to foreign capital loss carryforwards at December 31, 2022 and 2021, respectively. The Company has recorded a valuation allowance of $ 42 million and $ 74 million against these tax assets at December 31, 2022 and 2021, respectively, due to the uncertainty of their realization. The Company had $ 21 million of tax assets related to state income tax attributes (incentive credits and net operating loss carryforwards), net of federal tax benefit, at December 31, 2022 and 2021, a majority of which will expire between 2023 and 2027. Due to the uncertainty of realization, the Company recorded a valuation allowance of $ 15 million and $ 13 million related to state income tax assets net of federal tax benefit as of December 31, 2022 and 2021, respectively. The change in the valuation allowance was related to the expiration of certain state income tax attributes which were fully reserved in prior years. The Company remains subject to federal examination in the U.S. for the calendar tax years 2016 through 2022. The following table sets forth a rollforward of activity of unrecognized tax benefits for the year ended December 31, 2022 and 2021 as follows: ', '  Unrecognized Tax Benefits  December 31, 2022 December 31, 2021  (In millions) Beginning balance $ 157  $ 151  Additions related to current year’s tax positions 6  7  Additions related to prior years’ tax positions 26  15  Additions (adjustments) related to acquisitions 11  —  Reductions related to lapse of statute of limitations ( 6 ) ( 9 ) Settlements with tax authorities ( 43 ) ( 7 ) Ending balance $ 151  $ 157  ', 'The additions and reductions in unrecognized tax benefits shown in the table included effects related to net income and shareholders’ equity. The changes in unrecognized tax benefits did not have a material effect on the Company’s net income or cash flow. At December 31, 2022 and 2021, the Company had accrued interest and penalties on unrecognized tax benefits of $ 39 million. The Company is subject to income taxation and routine examinations in many jurisdictions around the world and frequently faces challenges regarding the amount of taxes due. These challenges include positions taken by the Company related to the timing, nature, and amount of deductions and the allocation of income among various jurisdictions. In its routine evaluations of the exposure associated with various tax filing positions, the Company recognizes a liability, when necessary, for estimated potential tax owed by the Company in accordance with applicable accounting standards. Resolution of the related tax positions, through negotiations with relevant tax authorities or through litigation, may take years to complete. Therefore, it is difficult to predict the timing for resolution of tax positions and the Company cannot predict or provide assurance as to the ultimate outcome of these ongoing or future examinations. However, the Company does not anticipate that the total amount of unrecognized tax benefits will increase or decrease significantly in the next twelve months. Given the long periods of time involved in resolving tax positions, the Company does not expect that the recognition of unrecognized tax benefits will have a material impact on the Company’s effective income tax rate in any given period. If the total amount of unrecognized tax benefits were recognized by the Company at one time, there would be a reduction of $ 148 million on the tax expense for that period. Archer-Daniels-Midland Company Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements (Continued) Note 13. Income Taxes (Continued) The Company’s subsidiary in Argentina, ADM Agro SRL (formerly ADM Argentina SA and Alfred C. Toepfer Argentina SRL), received tax assessments challenging transfer prices used to price grain exports for the tax years 1999 through 2011 and 2015. As of December 31, 2022, these assessments totaled $ 5 million in tax and up to $ 25 million in interest (adjusted for variation in currency exchange rates). The Argentine tax authorities conducted a review of income and other taxes paid by large exporters and processors of cereals and other agricultural commodities resulting in allegations of income tax evasion. The Company strongly believes that it has complied with all Argentine tax laws. Currently the Company is under audit for fiscal years 2016 and 2017. While the statute of limitations has expired for tax years 2012 and 2013, the Company cannot rule out receiving additional assessments challenging transfer prices used to price grain exports for years subsequent to 2015. The Company believes that it has appropriately evaluated the transactions underlying these assessments, and has concluded, based on Argentine tax law, that its tax position is more likely than not to be sustained based upon its technical merits, and accordingly, has not recorded a tax liability for these assessments. The Company intends to vigorously defend its position against any assessments. In 2014, the Company’s wholly-owned subsidiary in the Netherlands, ADM Europe B.V., received a tax assessment from the Netherlands tax authority challenging the transfer pricing aspects of a 2009 business reorganization, which involved two of its subsidiary companies in the Netherlands. As of December 31, 2022, this assessment was $ 87 million in tax and $ 31 million in interest (adjusted for variation in currency exchange rates). On April 23, 2020, the court issued an unfavorable ruling and in October 2020, assigned a third party expert to establish a valuation. During the second quarter of 2021, the third party expert issued a final valuation. On September 30, 2022, the court issued a ruling consistent with the valuation report, and the Dutch tax authorities have filed an appeal. ADM intends to file a cross-appeal in the first quarter of 2023. As of December 31, 2022, the Company has accrued its best estimate of what it believes will be the likely outcome of the litigation. Note 14. Leases Lessee Accounting The Company leases certain transportation equipment, plant equipment, office equipment, land, buildings, and storage facilities. Most leases include options to renew, with renewal terms that can extend the lease term from 6 months to 49 years. The renewal options are not included in the measurement of the right of use assets and lease liabilities unless the Company is reasonably certain to exercise the optional renewal periods. Certain leases also include index and non-index escalation clauses and options to purchase the leased property. Leases accounted for as finance leases were immaterial at December 31, 2022. As an accounting policy election, the Company does not apply the recognition requirements of Topic 842 to short-term leases in all of its underlying asset categories. The Company recognizes short-term lease payments in earnings on a straight-line basis over the lease term, and variable lease payments in the period in which the obligation for those payments is incurred. The Company also combines lease and non-lease contract components in all of its underlying asset categories as an accounting policy election. Archer-Daniels-Midland Company Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements (Continued) Note 14. Leases (Continued) The following table sets forth the amounts relating to the Company’s total lease cost and other information.

Archer-Daniels-Midland Company Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements (Continued) Note 15. Employee Benefit Plans The Company provides substantially all U.S. employees and employees at certain foreign subsidiaries with retirement benefits including defined benefit pension plans and defined contribution plans. The Company also provides certain eligible U.S. employees who retire under qualifying conditions with subsidized postretirement health care coverage or Health Care Reimbursement Accounts. In 2021, the Company amended the ADM Retirement Plan and the ADM Pension Plan for Hourly-Wage Employees (collectively, the “Plans”) and entered into two binding agreements to purchase: (1) a group annuity contract from Principal Life Insurance Company (“Principal”) and (2) two group annuity contracts, separately from American General Life Insurance Company (“AGL”) and from AGL’s affiliate, The United States Life Insurance Company in the City of New York (“USL”), irrevocably transferring the future benefit obligations and annuity administration for approximately 6,000 retirees and terminated vested participants from the Plans to Principal, AGL, and USL. The purchase of the group annuity contracts was funded directly by the Plans’ assets and reduced the Company’s pension obligations by approximately $ 0.7 billion. As a result of the transactions, the Company recognized a non-cash pretax pension settlement charge of $ 83 million for the year ended December 31, 2021. On July 31, 2017, the Company announced that all participants in the Company’s U.S. salaried pension plan and the Supplemental Executive Retirement Plan (SERP) began accruing benefits under the cash balance formula effective January 1, 2022. Benefits for participants who were accruing under the final average pay formula were frozen as of December 31, 2021, including pay and service through that date. The Company maintains 401(k) plans covering substantially all U.S. employees. The Company contributes cash to the plans to match qualifying employee contributions, and also provides a non-matching employer contribution of 1 % of pay to eligible participants. Under an employee stock ownership component of the 401(k) plans, employees may choose to invest in the Company’s stock as part of their own investment elections. Assets of the Company’s 401(k) plans consist primarily of listed common stocks and pooled funds. The Company’s 401(k) plans held 5.9 million shares of Company common stock at December 31, 2022, with a market value of $ 550 million. Cash dividends received on shares of Company common stock by these plans during the year ended December 31, 2022 were $ 10 million.

The Company uses the corridor approach when amortizing actuarial losses. Under the corridor approach, net unrecognized actuarial losses in excess of 10% of the greater of the projected benefit obligation or the market related value of plan assets are amortized over future periods. For plans with little to no active participants, the amortization period is the remaining average life expectancy of the participants. For plans with active participants, the amortization period is the remaining average service period of the active participants. The amortization periods range from 2 to 28 years for the Company’s defined benefit pension plans and from 5 to 19 years for the Company’s postretirement benefit plans. Included in AOCI for pension benefits at December 31, 2022, are the following amounts that have not yet been recognized in net periodic pension cost: unrecognized prior service credit of $ 75 million and unrecognized actuarial loss of $ 226 million. Archer-Daniels-Midland Company Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements (Continued)  Note 15. Employee Benefit Plans (Continued) Included in AOCI for postretirement benefits at December 31, 2022, are the following amounts that have not yet been recognized in net periodic postretirement benefit cost: unrecognized prior service cost of $ 1 million and unrecognized actuarial loss of $ 16 million. The following table sets forth the principal assumptions used in developing net periodic benefit cost:   Pension Benefits Postretirement Benefits December 31 2022 December 31 2021 December 31 2022 December 31 2021 Discount rate 2.5 % 2.3 % 2.7 % 2.3 % Expected return on plan assets 5.0 % 6.0 % N/A N/A Rate of compensation increase 4.2 % 4.8 % N/A N/A Interest crediting rate 1.9 % 2.0 % N/A N/A The following table sets forth the principal assumptions used in developing the year-end actuarial present value of the projected benefit obligations:   Pension Benefits Postretirement Benefits December 31 2022 December 31 2021 December 31 2022 December 31 2021 Discount rate 4.8  % 2.5  % 5.1 % 2.7 % Rate of compensation increase 4.3  % 4.2  % N/A N/A Interest crediting rate 3.9  % 1.9  % N/A N/A The projected benefit obligation, accumulated benefit obligation, and fair value of plan assets for the pension plans with projected benefit obligations in excess of plan assets were $ 1.3 billion, $ 1.3 billion, and $ 0.9 billion, respectively, as of December 31, 2022, and $ 1.7 billion, $ 1.6 billion, and $ 1.2 billion, respectively, as of December 31, 2021. The projected benefit obligation, accumulated benefit obligation, and fair value of plan assets for the pension plans with accumulated benefit obligations in excess of plan assets were $ 1.2 billion, $ 1.2 billion, and $ 0.8 billion, respectively, as of December 31, 2022 and $ 1.7 billion, $ 1.6 billion, and $ 1.2 billion, respectively, as of December 31, 2021. The accumulated benefit obligation for all pension plans as of December 31, 2022 and 2021, was $ 1.6 billion and $ 2.1 billion, respectively. For postretirement benefit measurement purposes, a 6.9 % annual rate of increase in the per capita cost of covered health care benefits was assumed for the year ended December 31, 2022. The rate was assumed to decrease gradually to 4.5 % by 2031 and remain at that level thereafter. Plan Assets The Company’s employee benefit plan assets are principally comprised of the following types of investments: Common stock: Equity securities are valued based on quoted exchange prices and are classified within Level 1 of the valuation hierarchy. Mutual funds: Mutual funds are valued at the closing price reported on the active market on which they are traded and are classified within Level 1 of the valuation hierarchy. Archer-Daniels-Midland Company Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements (Continued)  Note 15. Employee Benefit Plans (Continued) Common collective trust (CCT) funds: The fair values of the CCTs are valued using net asset value (NAV). The investments in CCTs are comprised of U.S. and international equity, fixed income, and other securities. The investments are valued at NAV provided by administrators of the funds. Corporate debt instruments: Corporate debt instruments are valued using third-party pricing services and are classified within Level 2 of the valuation hierarchy. U.S. Treasury instruments: U.S. Treasury instruments are valued at the closing price reported on the active market on which they are traded and are classified within Level 1 of the valuation hierarchy. U.S. government agency, state, and local government bonds: U.S. government agency obligations and state and municipal debt securities are valued using third-party pricing services and are classified within Level 2 of the valuation hierarchy. The methods described above may produce a fair value calculation that may not be indicative of net realizable value or reflective of future fair values. Furthermore, while the Company believes its valuation methods are appropriate and consistent with other market participants’ methods, the use of different methodologies or assumptions to determine the fair value of certain financial instruments could result in a different fair value measurement at the reporting date. The following tables set forth, by level within the fair value hierarchy, the fair value of plan assets as of December 31, 2022 and 2021.

The following table sets forth the actual asset allocation for the Company’s global pension plan assets as of the measurement date:   December 31 2022 (1)(2) December 31 2021 (2) Equity securities 33 % 47 % Debt securities 62 % 44 % Other 5 % 9 % Total 100 % 100 % (1) The Company’s U.S. pension plans contain approximately 66 % of the Company’s global pension plan assets. The actual asset allocation for the Company’s U.S. pension plans as of the measurement date consists of 37 % equity securities and 63 % debt securities. The target asset allocation for the Company’s U.S. pension plans is approximately the same as the actual asset allocation. The actual asset allocation for the Company’s foreign pension plans as of the measurement date consists of 24 % equity securities, 62 % debt securities, and 14 % other. The target asset allocation for the Company’s foreign pension plans is approximately the same as the actual asset allocation. (2) The Company’s pension plans did not directly hold any shares of Company common stock as of the December 31, 2022 and 2021 measurement dates.  Archer-Daniels-Midland Company Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements (Continued)  Note 15. Employee Benefit Plans (Continued) Investment objectives for the Company’s plan assets are to: • Optimize the long-term return on plan assets at an acceptable level of risk. • Maintain a broad diversification across asset classes and among investment managers. • Maintain careful control of the risk level within each asset class. Asset allocation targets promote optimal expected return and volatility characteristics given the long-term time horizon for fulfilling the obligations of the pension plans. Selection of the targeted asset allocation for plan assets was based upon a review of the expected return and risk characteristics of each asset class, as well as the correlation of returns among asset classes. The U.S. pension plans target asset allocation is also based on an asset and liability study that is updated periodically. Investment guidelines are established with each investment manager. These guidelines provide the parameters within which the investment managers agree to operate, including criteria that determine eligible and ineligible securities, diversification requirements, and credit quality standards, where applicable. In some countries, derivatives may be used to gain market exposure in an efficient and timely manner; however, derivatives may not be used to leverage the portfolio beyond the market value of underlying investments. The Company uses external consultants to assist in monitoring the investment strategy and asset mix for the Company’s plan assets. To develop the Company’s expected long-term rate of return assumption on plan assets, the Company generally uses long-term historical return information for the targeted asset mix identified in asset and liability studies. Adjustments are made to the expected long-term rate of return assumption when deemed necessary based upon revised expectations of future investment performance of the overall investment markets. Contributions and Expected Future Benefit Payments Based on actuarial calculations, the Company expects to contribute $ 25 million to the pension plans and $ 14 million to the postretirement benefit plan during 2023. The Company may elect to make additional discretionary contributions during this period. The following benefit payments, which reflect expected future service, are expected to be paid by the benefit plans:   Pension Benefits Postretirement Benefits  (In millions) 2023 $ 64  $ 14  2024 70  13  2025 76  12  2026 82  11  2027 85  10  2028-2032 524  44  Note 16.

Segment and Geographic Information The Company’s operations are organized, managed, and classified into three reportable business segments: Ag Services and Oilseeds, Carbohydrate Solutions, and Nutrition. Each of these segments is organized based upon the nature of products and services offered. The Company’s remaining operations are not reportable segments, as defined by the applicable accounting standard , and are classified as Other Business. The Ag Services and Oilseeds segment includes global activities related to the origination, merchandising, transportation, and storage of agricultural raw materials, and the crushing and further processing of oilseeds such as soybeans and soft seeds (cottonseed, sunflower seed, canola, rapeseed, and flaxseed) into vegetable oils and protein meals. Oilseeds products produced and marketed by the segment include ingredients for food, feed, energy, and industrial customers. Crude vegetable oils produced by the segment’s crushing activities are sold “as is” to manufacturers of renewable green diesel and other customers or are further processed by refining, blending, bleaching, and deodorizing into salad oils. Salad oils are sold “as is” or are further processed by hydrogenating and/or interesterifying into margarine, shortening, and other food products. Partially refined oils are used to produce biodiesel and glycols or are sold to other manufacturers for use in chemicals, paints, and other industrial products. Oilseed protein meals are principally sold to third parties to be used as ingredients in commercial livestock and poultry feeds. The Ag Services and Oilseeds segment is also a major supplier of peanuts and peanut-derived ingredients to both the U.S. and export markets. In North America, cotton cellulose pulp is manufactured and sold to the chemical, paper, and other industrial markets. The Ag Services and Oilseeds segment’s grain sourcing, handling, and transportation network (including barge, ocean-going vessel, truck, rail, and container freight services) provides reliable and efficient services to the Company’s customers and agricultural processing operations. The Ag Services and Oilseeds segment also includes agricultural commodity and feed product import, export, and global distribution, and structured trade finance activities. The Company engages in various structured trade finance activities to leverage its global trade flows.

Archer-Daniels-Midland Company Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements (Continued) Note 17. Segment and Geographic Information (Continued) The Carbohydrate Solutions segment is engaged in corn and wheat wet and dry milling and other activities. The Carbohydrate Solutions segment converts corn and wheat into products and ingredients used in the food and beverage industry including sweeteners, corn and wheat starches, syrup, glucose, wheat flour, and dextrose. Dextrose and starch are used by the Carbohydrate Solutions segment as feedstocks in other downstream processes. By fermentation of dextrose, the Carbohydrate Solutions segment produces alcohol and other food and animal feed ingredients. Ethyl alcohol is produced by the Company for industrial use in products such as hand sanitizers and ethanol for use in gasoline due to its ability to increase octane as an extender and oxygenate. Corn gluten feed and meal, as well as distillers’ grains, are produced for use as animal feed ingredients. Corn germ, a by-product of the wet milling process, is further processed into vegetable oil and protein meal. Other Carbohydrate Solutions products include citric acids which are used in various food and industrial products. The Carbohydrate Solutions segment has announced various memorandums of understanding with potential strategic partners leveraging our core production capabilities and carbon sequestration experience to facilitate the production of low carbon, bio-based products such as sustainable aviation fuel and innovative renewable chemicals. This segment also includes the Company’s share of the results of its equity investments in Hungrana Ltd., Almidones Mexicanos S.A., and Aston Foods and Food Ingredients. In November 2021, the Company sold its ethanol production complex in Peoria, Illinois. In August 2022, the Company launched two joint ventures, GreenWise Lactic and LG Chem Illinois Biochem, with LG Chem, a leading global diversified chemical company, for the U.S. production of lactic acid and polylactic acid to meet growing demand for a wide variety of plant-based products. The Nutrition segment serves various end markets including food, beverages, nutritional supplements, and feed and premix for livestock, aquaculture, and pet food.

Note 19. Sale of Accounts Receivable The Company has an accounts receivable securitization program (the “Program”) with certain commercial paper conduit purchasers and committed purchasers (collectively, the “First Purchasers”). Under the Program, certain U.S.-originated trade accounts receivable are sold to a wholly-owned bankruptcy-remote entity, ADM Receivables, LLC (“ADM Receivables”). Prior to October 1, 2020, ADM Receivables transferred such purchased accounts receivable in their entirety to the First Purchasers pursuant to a receivables purchase agreement. In exchange for the transfer of the accounts receivable, ADM Receivables received a cash payment up to a certain amount and an additional amount upon the collection of the accounts receivable (deferred consideration). On October 1, 2020, the Company restructured the First Program from a deferred purchase price to a pledge structure. Under the new structure, ADM Receivables transfers certain of the purchased accounts receivable to each of the First Purchasers together with a security interest in all of its right, title, and interest in the remaining purchased accounts receivable. In exchange, ADM Receivables receives a cash payment of up to $ 1.8 billion for the accounts receivable transferred. The First Program terminates on May 18, 2023, unless extended. The Company also has an accounts receivable securitization program (the “Second Program”) with certain commercial paper conduit purchasers and committed purchasers (collectively, the “Second Purchasers”). Under the Second Program, certain non-U.S.-originated trade accounts receivable are sold to a wholly-owned bankruptcy-remote entity, ADM Ireland Receivables Company (ADM Ireland Receivables). Prior to April 1, 2020, ADM Ireland Receivables transferred such purchased accounts receivable in their entirety to the Second Purchasers pursuant to a receivables purchase agreement. In exchange for the transfer of the accounts receivable, ADM Ireland Receivables received a cash payment up to a certain amount and an additional amount upon the collection of the accounts receivable (deferred consideration). On April 1, 2020, the Company restructured the Second Program from a deferred purchase price to a pledge structure. Under the new structure, ADM Ireland Receivables transfers certain of the purchased accounts receivable to each of the Second Purchasers together with a security interest in all of its right, title, and interest in the remaining purchased accounts receivable. In exchange, ADM Ireland Receivables receives a cash payment of up to $ 0.8 billion (€ 0.8 billion) for the accounts receivables transferred. The Second Program terminates on March 16, 2023, unless extended. Archer-Daniels-Midland Company Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements (Continued) Note 19. Sale of Accounts Receivable (Continued) Under the First and Second Programs (collectively, the “Programs”), ADM Receivables and ADM Ireland Receivables use the cash proceeds from the transfer of receivables to the First Purchasers and Second Purchasers (collectively, the “Purchasers”) and other consideration, as applicable, to finance the purchase of receivables from the Company and the ADM subsidiaries originating the receivables. The Company accounts for these transfers as sales. The Company acts as a servicer for the transferred receivables. At December 31, 2022 and 2021, the Company did not record a servicing asset or liability related to its retained responsibility, based on its assessment of the servicing fee, market values for similar transactions, and its cost of servicing the receivables sold. As of December 31, 2022 and 2021, the fair value of trade receivables transferred to the Purchasers under the Programs and derecognized from the Company’s consolidated balance sheet was $ 2.6 billion and $ 2.2 billion, respectively. Total receivables sold were $ 59.0 billion, $ 50.3 billion, and $ 35.0 billion for the years ended December 31, 2022, 2021, and 2020, respectively. Cash collections from customers on receivables sold were $ 56.9 billion, $ 47.3 billion, and $ 34.2 billion for the years ended December 31, 2022, 2021, and 2020, respectively. Of the 2020 amount, $ 6.7 billion was cash collections on the deferred consideration reflected as cash inflows from investing activities for the years ended December 31, 2020. Receivables pledged as collateral to the Purchasers were $ 0.6 billion and $ 0.5 billion as of December 31, 2022 and 2021, respectively. Transfers of receivables under the Programs during the years ended December 31, 2022, 2021, and 2020 resulted in an expense for the loss on sale of $ 21 million, $ 11 million, and $ 9 million, respectively, which is classified as selling, general, and administrative expenses in the consolidated statements of earnings. In accordance with the amended guidance of Topic 230, the Company reflects cash flows related to the deferred receivables consideration as investing activities in its consolidated statements of cash flows. All other cash flows are classified as operating activities because the cash received from the Purchasers upon both the sale and collection of the receivables is not subject to significant interest rate risk given the short-term nature of the Company’s trade receivables. Note 20. Legal Proceedings The Company is routinely involved in a number of actual or threatened legal actions, including those involving alleged personal injuries, employment law, product liability, intellectual property, environmental issues, alleged tax liability (see Note 13 for information on income tax matters), and class actions. The Company also routinely receives inquiries from regulators and other government authorities relating to various aspects of our business, and at any given time, the Company has matters at various stages of resolution. The outcomes of these matters are not within our complete control and may not be known for prolonged periods of time. In some actions, claimants seek damages, as well as other relief including injunctive relief, that could require significant expenditures or result in lost revenues. In accordance with applicable accounting standards, the Company records a liability in its consolidated financial statements for material loss contingencies when a loss is known or considered probable and the amount can be reasonably estimated. If the reasonable estimate of a known or probable loss is a range, and no amount within the range is a better estimate than any other, the minimum amount of the range is accrued. If a material loss contingency is reasonably possible but not known or probable, and can be reasonably estimated, the estimated loss or range of loss is disclosed in the notes to the consolidated financial statements. When determining the estimated loss or range of loss, significant judgment is required to estimate the amount and timing of a loss to be recorded. Estimates of probable losses resulting from litigation and governmental proceedings involving the Company are inherently difficult to predict, particularly when the matters are in early procedural stages, with incomplete facts or legal discovery; involve unsubstantiated or indeterminate claims for damages; potentially involve penalties, fines, disgorgement, or punitive damages; or could result in a change in business practice. Archer-Daniels-Midland Company Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements (Continued)  Note 20. Legal Proceedings (Continued) On September 4, 2019, AOT Holding AG (“AOT”) filed a putative class action under the U.S. Commodities Exchange Act in federal district court in Urbana, Illinois, alleging that the Company sought to manipulate the benchmark price used to price and settle ethanol derivatives traded on futures exchanges. On March 16, 2021, AOT filed an amended complaint adding a second named plaintiff Maize Capital Group, LLC (“Maize”). AOT and Maize allege that members of the putative class collectively suffered damages calculated to be between approximately $500 million to over $2.0 billion as a result of the Company’s alleged actions. On July 14, 2020, Green Plains Inc. and its related entities (“GP”) filed a putative class action lawsuit, alleging substantially the same operative facts, in federal court in Nebraska, seeking to represent sellers of ethanol. On July 23, 2020, Midwest Renewable Energy, LLC (“MRE”) filed a putative class action in federal court in Illinois alleging substantially the same operative facts and asserting claims under the Sherman Act. On November 11, 2020, United Wisconsin Grain Producers LLC (“UWGP”) and five other ethanol producers filed a lawsuit in federal court in Illinois alleging substantially the same facts and asserting claims under the Sherman Act and Illinois, Iowa, and Wisconsin law. The court granted ADM’s motion to dismiss the MRE and UWGP complaints without prejudice on August 9, 2021 and September 28, 2021, respectively. On August 16, 2021, the court granted ADM’s motion to dismiss the GP complaint, dismissing one claim with prejudice and declining jurisdiction over the remaining state law claim. MRE filed an amended complaint on August 30, 2021, which ADM moved to dismiss on September 27, 2021. UWGP filed an amended complaint on October 19, 2021, which the court dismissed on July 12, 2022. UWGP has appealed the dismissal to the United States Court of Appeals for the Seventh Circuit. On October 26, 2021, GP filed a new complaint in Nebraska federal district court, alleging substantially the same facts and asserting a claim for tortious interference with contractual relations. On March 18, 2022, the Nebraska federal district court granted ADM’s motion to transfer the GP case back to the Central District of Illinois for further proceedings. ADM moved to dismiss the complaint on May 20, 2022 and on December 30, 2022, the court dismissed GP’s complaint with prejudice. GP has appealed the dismissal. The Company denies liability, and is vigorously defending itself in these actions. As these actions are in pretrial proceedings, the Company is unable at this time to predict the final outcome with any reasonable degree of certainty, but believes the outcome will not have a material adverse effect on its financial condition, results of operations, or cash flows. Report of Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm The Board of Directors and Shareholders Archer-Daniels-Midland Company Opinion on the Financial Statements We have audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheets of Archer-Daniels-Midland Company (the Company) as of December 31, 2022 and 2021, the related consolidated statements of earnings, comprehensive income (loss), cash flows, and shareholders’ equity for each of the three years in the period ended December 31, 2022, and the related notes and financial statement schedule listed in the Index at Item 15(a)(2) (collectively referred to as the “consolidated financial statements”). In our opinion, the consolidated financial statements present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of the Company at December 31, 2022 and 2021, and the results of its operations and its cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended December 31, 2022, in conformity with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles. We also have audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States) (PCAOB), the Company’s internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2022, based on criteria established in Internal Control-Integrated Framework issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (2013 Framework) and our report dated February 14, 2023 expressed an unqualified opinion thereon. Basis for Opinion These financial statements are the responsibility of the Company’s management. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the Company’s financial statements based on our audits. We are a public accounting firm registered with the PCAOB and are required to be independent with respect to the Company in accordance with the U.S. federal securities laws and the applicable rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB. We conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material misstatement, whether due to error or fraud. Our audits included performing procedures to assess the risks of material misstatement of the financial statements, whether due to error or fraud, and performing procedures that respond to those risks. Such procedures included examining, on a test basis, evidence regarding the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements. Our audits also included evaluating the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall presentation of the financial statements. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion. Critical Audit Matter The critical audit matter communicated below is a matter arising from the current period audit of the financial statements that was communicated or required to be communicated to the audit committee and that: (1) relates to accounts or disclosures that are material to the financial statements and (2) involved our especially challenging, subjective, or complex judgments. The communication of the critical audit matter does not alter in any way our opinion on the consolidated financial statements, taken as a whole, and we are not, by communicating the critical audit matter below, providing a separate opinion on the critical audit matter or on the accounts or disclosures to which it relates.  Market or Fair Values of Certain Merchandisable Agricultural Commodity Inventories, Inventory-Related Payables, and Forward Commodity Purchase and Sales Contracts Description of the Matter As explained in Notes 1 and 4 to the consolidated financial statements, certain merchandisable agricultural commodity inventory and inventory-related payables are stated at market or fair value. Forward commodity purchase and sales contracts that qualify as derivative contracts are also stated at market or fair value. The merchandisable agricultural commodity inventory, inventory-related payables, and forward commodity purchase and sales contracts are considered level 2 and 3 fair value instruments. As of December 31, 2022, the market or fair values of certain merchandisable agricultural commodity inventories, inventory-related payables, forward commodity contracts in an asset position, and forward commodity contracts in a liability position were $9,041 million, $1,270 million, $1,337 million, and $1,268 million, respectively. Auditing the estimated market or fair values of merchandisable agricultural commodity inventories, inventory-related payables, and forward commodity purchase and sale contracts is complex due to the judgment involved in determining market or fair value, specifically related to determining the estimated basis adjustments, which represent the adjustment made to exchange quoted prices to arrive at the market or fair values of certain merchandisable agricultural commodity inventories, inventory-related payables, and forward commodity purchase and sales contracts. The basis adjustments are generally determined using inputs from competitor or broker quotations or market transactions and are impacted by specific local supply and demand characteristics at each facility and the overall market. Factors such as substitute products, weather, fuel costs, contract terms, and futures prices also impact these basis adjustments. How We Addressed the Matter in Our Audit We obtained an understanding, evaluated the design and tested the operating effectiveness of controls over the Company’s determination of the estimated market or fair values of certain merchandisable agricultural commodity inventories, inventory-related payables, and forward commodity purchase and sale contracts. Our tests included controls over the estimation process supporting the basis adjustments. To test the estimated market or fair values of certain merchandisable agricultural commodity inventories, inventory-related payables, and forward commodity purchase and sale contracts, our audit procedures included, among others, evaluating (i) the Company’s selection of the principal market, (ii) the inputs for the basis adjustments, and (iii) the completeness and accuracy of the underlying data supporting the basis adjustments. For example, we evaluated management’s methodology for determining the basis adjustment including assessing the principal market identified and sources utilized by management to support the basis adjustment. Specifically, we compared the basis adjustments used by management to competitor and broker quotations, trade publications, and/or recently executed transactions. Further, we investigated, to the extent necessary, basis adjustments that were inconsistent with third party available information. Finally, we evaluated the adequacy of the Company’s financial statement disclosures related to the estimated market or fair values of certain merchandisable agricultural inventories, inventory-related payables, and forward commodity purchase and sale contracts. /s/ Ernst & Young LLP We have served as the Company’s auditor since 1930. Saint Louis, Missouri February 14, 2023 Report of Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm The Board of Directors and Shareholders Archer-Daniels-Midland Company Opinion on Internal Control over Financial Reporting We have audited Archer-Daniels-Midland Company’s internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2022, based on criteria established in Internal Control - Integrated Framework issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (2013 Framework) (the COSO criteria). In our opinion, Archer-Daniels-Midland Company (the Company) maintained, in all material respects, effective internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2022, based on the COSO criteria. We also have audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States) (PCAOB), the consolidated balance sheets of Archer-Daniels-Midland Company as of December 31, 2022 and 2021, the related consolidated statements of earnings, comprehensive income (loss), cash flows, and shareholders’ equity for each of the three years in the period ended December 31, 2022, and the related notes and financial statement schedule listed in the Index at Item 15(a)(2), and our report dated February 14, 2023 expressed an unqualified opinion thereon. Basis for Opinion The Company’s management is responsible for maintaining effective internal control over financial reporting and for its assessment of the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting included in the accompanying Management’s Report on Internal Control Over Financial Reporting. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the Company’s internal control over financial reporting based on our audit. We are a public accounting firm registered with the PCAOB and are required to be independent with respect to the Company in accordance with the U.S. federal securities laws and the applicable rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB. We conducted our audit in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether effective internal control over financial reporting was maintained in all material respects. Our audit included obtaining an understanding of internal control over financial reporting, assessing the risk that a material weakness exists, testing and evaluating the design and operating effectiveness of internal control based on the assessed risk, and performing such other procedures as we considered necessary in the circumstances. We believe that our audit provides a reasonable basis for our opinion. Definition and Limitations of Internal Control Over Financial Reporting ', 'A company’s internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. A company’s internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that (1) pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company; (2) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the company; and (3) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the company’s assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements. ', 'Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate. /s/ Ernst & Young LLP Saint Louis, Missouri February 14, 2023  ']\n"

       "' \\n\\nThe Company is subject to numerous laws, regulations, and mandates globally which could adversely affect the Company’s operating results and forward strategy. \\n\\nThe Company does business globally, connecting crops and markets in over 190 countries, and is required to comply with laws and regulations administered by the United States federal government as well as state, local, and non-U.S. governmental authorities in numerous areas including: accounting and income taxes, anti-corruption, anti-bribery, global trade, trade sanctions, privacy and security, environmental, product safety, and handling and production of regulated substances. The Company frequently faces challenges from U.S. and foreign tax authorities regarding the amount of taxes due including questions regarding the timing, amount of deductions, the allocation of income among various tax jurisdictions, and further risks related to changing tax laws domestically and globally. Any failure to comply with applicable laws and regulations or appropriately resolve these challenges could subject the Company to administrative, civil, and criminal remedies, including fines, penalties, disgorgement, injunctions, and recalls of its products, and damage to its reputation. \\n\\nRegulations specifically affecting the agricultural sector and related industries; regulatory policies or matters that affect a variety of businesses; and taxation polices could adversely affect the Company’s operating results. \\n\\nAgricultural production and trade flows are subject to government policies, mandates, regulations, and trade agreements, including taxes, tariffs, duties, subsidies, incentives, foreign exchange rates, and import and export restrictions, including policies related to genetically modified organisms, traceability standards, sustainable practices, product safety and labeling, renewable fuels, and low carbon fuel mandates. These policies can influence the planting of certain crops; the location and size of crop production; whether unprocessed or processed commodity products are traded; the volume and types of imports and exports; the availability and competitiveness of feedstocks as raw materials; the viability and volume of production of certain of the Company’s products; and industry profitability. For example, changes in government policies or regulations of ethanol and biodiesel including, but not limited to, changes in the Renewable Fuel Standard program under the Energy Independence and Security Act of 2007 in the United States, including the treatment of small refinery exemptions, can have an impact on the Company’s operating results. International trade regulations can adversely affect agricultural commodity trade flows by limiting or disrupting trade between countries or regions. Regulations of financial markets and instruments, including the Dodd-Frank Act, Consumer Protection Act, and the European Market Infrastructure Regulation, create uncertainty and may lead to additional risks and costs, and could adversely affect the Company’s futures commission merchant business and its agricultural commodity risk management practices. Future government policies may adversely affect the supply of, demand for, and prices of the Company’s products; adversely affect the Company’s ability to deploy adequate hedging programs; restrict the Company’s ability to do business in its existing and target markets; and adversely affect the Company’s revenues and operating results. \\n\\nThe Company’s strategy involves expanding the volume and diversity of crops it merchandises and processes, expanding the global reach of its core model, expanding its value-added product portfolio, and expanding the sustainable agriculture programs and partnerships it participates in. Government policies including, but not limited to, antitrust and competition law, trade restrictions, food safety regulations, sustainability requirements, and traceability, can impact the Company’s ability to execute this strategy successfully. \\n\\n '"

Unless the context requires otherwise, references in this report to “B&G Foods,” “our company,” “we,” “us” and “our” refer to B&G Foods, Inc. and its subsidiaries. Our financial statements are presented on a consolidated basis.We operate in a single industry segment and manufacture, sell and distribute a diverse portfolio of high-quality shelf-stable and frozen foods across the United States, Canada and Puerto Rico. Our products include frozen and canned vegetables, vegetable, canola and other cooking oils, vegetable shortening, cooking sprays, oatmeal and other hot cereals, fruit spreads, canned meats and beans, bagel chips, spices, seasonings, hot sauces, wine vinegar, maple syrup, molasses, salad dressings, pizza crusts, Mexican-style sauces, dry soups, taco shells and kits, salsas, pickles, peppers, tomato-based products, cookies and crackers, baking powder, baking soda, corn starch, nut clusters and other specialty products. Our products are marketed under many recognized brands, including Ac’cent , B&G , B&M , Baker’s Joy , Bear Creek Country Kitchens , Brer Rabbit , Canoleo , Cary’s , Clabber Girl, Cream of Rice , Cream of Wheat, Crisco , Dash, Davis, Devonsheer , Don Pepino , Durkee , Emeril’s , Grandma’s Molasses , Green Giant , Joan of Arc , Las Palmas , Le Sueur , MacDonald’s , Mama Mary’s , Maple Grove Farms of Vermont , McCann’s , Molly McButter , New York Flatbreads , New York Style , Old London , Ortega , Polaner , Red Devil , Regina , Rumford, Sa-són , Sclafani , Spice Islands , Spring  Tree , Sugar Twin , Tone’s , Trappey’s , TrueNorth , Underwood , Vermont Maid , Victoria , Weber and Wright’s . We also sell and distribute Static Guard , a household product brand . We compete in the retail grocery, foodservice, specialty, private label, club and mass merchandiser channels of distribution. We sell and distribute our products directly and via a network of independent brokers and distributors to supermarket chains, foodservice outlets, mass merchants, warehouse clubs, non-food outlets and specialty distributors.Sales of a number of our products tend to be seasonal and may be influenced by holidays, changes in seasons/weather or certain other annual events. In general, our sales are higher in the first and fourth quarter. We purchase most of the produce used to make our frozen and shelf-stable canned vegetables, pickles, relishes, peppers, tomatoes and other related specialty items during the months of June through October, and we generally purchase the majority of our maple syrup requirements during the months of April through August. Consequently, our liquidity needs are greatest during these periods.Fiscal Year Typically, our fiscal years and fiscal quarters consist of 52 and 13 weeks, respectively, ending on the Saturday closest to December 31 in the case of our fiscal year and fourth fiscal quarter, and on the Saturday closest to the end of the corresponding calendar quarter in the case of our other fiscal quarters. As a result, a 53rd week is added to our fiscal year every five or six years .Our fiscal year ending December 30, 2023 (fiscal 2023) contains, and our fiscal years ended December 31, 2022 (fiscal 2022) and January 1, 2022 (fiscal 2021) each contained, 52 weeks and each quarter of fiscal 2022 contains, and each quarter of fiscal 2022 and fiscal 2021 contained, 13 weeks. Our fiscal year ended January 2, 2021 (fiscal 2020) contained 53 weeks. Generally, when a 53rd week occurs, our fourth fiscal quarter contains 14 weeks. However, based upon a third quarter end date of October 3, 2020 (the Saturday closest to September 30) and a fourth quarter end date of January 2, 2021 (the Saturday closest to December 31), the third quarter of fiscal 2020 contained 14 weeks and the fourth quarter of 2020 contained 13 weeks.Business and Credit Concentrations Our exposure to credit loss in the event of non-payment of accounts receivable by customers is estimated in the amount of the allowance for doubtful accounts. We perform ongoing credit evaluations of the financial condition of our customers. Our top ten customers accounted for approximately 60.5 %, 60.8 % and 62.6 % of consolidated net sales in fiscal 2022, 2021 and 2020, respectively. Our top ten customers accounted for approximately 60.3 %, 59.8 % and 62.5 % of our consolidated trade accounts receivables as of the end of fiscal 2022, 2021 and 2020, respectively. Other than - 61 -B&G FOODS, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements (Continued) December 31, 2022 , January 1, 2022 and January 2, 2021 \\u200b Walmart, which accounted for approximately 27.3 %, 27.7 % and 26.5 % of our consolidated net sales in fiscal 2022, 2021 and 2020, respectively, no single customer accounted for more than 10.0% of consolidated net sales in fiscal 2022, 2021 or 2020. Other than Walmart, which accounted for approximately 30.6 %, 28.9 % and 32.6 % of our consolidated trade accounts receivables as of the end of fiscal 2022, 2021 and 2020, respectively, no single customer accounted for more than 10.0% of our consolidated trade accounts receivables as of the end of fiscal 2022, 2021 and 2020. As of December 31, 2022, we do not believe we have any significant concentration of credit risk with respect to our consolidated trade accounts receivable with any single customer whose failure or nonperformance would materially affect our results other than as described above with respect to Walmart.During fiscal 2022, 2021 and 2020, our sales to foreign countries represented approximately 7.8 %, 8.3 % and 7.8 %, respectively, of net sales. Our foreign sales are primarily to customers in Canada.(2) Summary of Significant Accounting Policies(a) Basis of Presentation The consolidated financial statements include the accounts of B&G Foods, Inc. and its subsidiaries. All intercompany balances and transactions have been eliminated.(b) Use of Estimates ', 'The preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles in the United States (GAAP) requires our management to make a number of estimates and assumptions relating to the reporting of assets and liabilities and the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the consolidated financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period. Some of the more significant estimates and assumptions made by management involve revenue recognition as it relates to trade and consumer promotion expenses; pension benefits; acquisition accounting fair value allocations; the recoverability of goodwill, other intangible assets, property, plant and equipment and deferred tax assets; and the determination of the useful life of customer relationship and finite-lived trademark intangible assets. Actual results could differ significantly from these estimates and assumptions.', 'Management evaluates its estimates and assumptions on an ongoing basis using historical experience and other factors that management believes to be reasonable under the circumstances, including the current economic environment. We adjust such estimates and assumptions when facts and circumstances dictate. Volatility in the credit and equity markets can increase the uncertainty inherent in such estimates and assumptions.(c) Subsequent Events We have evaluated subsequent events for disclosure through the date of issuance of the accompanying consolidated financial statements.(d) Cash and Cash Equivalents For purposes of the consolidated statements of cash flows, all highly liquid instruments with maturities of three months or less when acquired are considered to be cash and cash equivalents.(e) Inventories Inventories are stated at the lower of cost or net realizable value and include direct material, direct labor, overhead, warehousing and product transfer costs. Cost is determined using the first-in, first-out and average cost methods. Inventories have been reduced by an allowance for excess, obsolete and unsaleable inventories. The allowance is an estimate based on our management’s review of inventories on hand compared to estimated future usage and sales.(f) Property, Plant and Equipment Property, plant and equipment are stated at cost. Depreciation on plant and equipment is calculated using the straight-line method over the estimated useful lives of the assets, 10 to 30 years for buildings and improvements, 5 to 12 years for machinery and equipment, and 2 to 5 years for office furniture and vehicles. Leasehold improvements are - 62 -B&G FOODS, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements (Continued) December 31, 2022 , January 1, 2022 and January 2, 2021 \\u200b amortized on a straight-line basis over the shorter of the lease term or estimated useful life of the asset. Expenditures for maintenance, repairs and minor replacements are charged to current operations. Expenditures for major replacements and betterments are capitalized. We capitalize interest on qualifying assets based on our effective interest rate. During fiscal 2022, 2021 and 2020, we capitalized $ 1.5 million, $ 1.2 million and $ 0.7 million, respectively.(g) Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets Goodwill and indefinite-lived intangible assets (trademarks) are not amortized. As a result, these assets are tested for impairment through qualitative and quantitative assessments at least annually and whenever events or circumstances occur indicating that goodwill or indefinite-lived intangible assets might be impaired. We perform the annual impairment tests as of the last day of each fiscal year. We test our goodwill and indefinite-lived intangible assets by comparing the fair values with the carrying values and recognize a loss for the difference. The annual goodwill impairment testing is performed by estimating the fair value of our company based on discounted cash flows that reflect certain third-party market value indicators. Similarly, the annual impairment testing for indefinite-lived intangible assets is performed by estimating the fair value of our indefinite-lived intangible assets based on discounted cash flows that reflect certain third-party market value indicators.Calculating the fair values of goodwill and indefinite-lived intangible assets for these purposes requires significant estimates and assumptions by management, including future cash flows consistent with management’s expectations, annual sales growth rates, and certain assumptions underlying a discount rate based on available market data. Significant management judgment is necessary to estimate the impact of competitive operating, macroeconomic and other factors to estimate the future levels of sales and cash flows.Customer relationships and finite-lived trademarks are presented at cost, net of accumulated amortization, and are amortized on a straight-line basis over their estimated useful lives of 10 to 20 years .(h) Deferred Debt Financing Costs Deferred debt financing costs are capitalized and amortized over the term of the related debt agreements and are included as a reduction of long-term debt, except for the revolving credit facility, for which the deferred debt financing costs are included in other assets. Amortization of deferred debt financing costs for fiscal 2022, 2021 and 2020 was $ 4.7 million, $ 4.6 million and $ 4.7 million, respectively.(i) Long-Lived Assets Long-lived assets, such as property, plant and equipment, and intangible assets with estimated useful lives, are depreciated or amortized over their respective estimated useful lives to their estimated residual values, and reviewed for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of an asset may not be recoverable. Recoverability of assets to be held and used is measured by a comparison of the carrying amount of an asset to estimated undiscounted future net cash flows expected to be generated by the asset. If the carrying amount of an asset exceeds its estimated undiscounted future net cash flows, an impairment charge is recognized by the amount by which the carrying amount of the asset exceeds the fair value of the asset. Recoverability of assets held for sale is measured by a comparison of the carrying amount of an asset or asset group to their fair value less estimated costs to sell. Estimating future cash flows and calculating the fair value of assets requires significant estimates and assumptions by management.Assets to be disposed of are separately presented in the consolidated balance sheets and are no longer depreciated.(j) Accumulated Other Comprehensive Loss Accumulated other comprehensive loss includes foreign currency translation adjustments relating to assets and liabilities located in our foreign subsidiaries and changes in our pension benefits due to the initial adoption and ongoing application of the authoritative accounting literature relating to pensions, net of tax. - 63 -B&G FOODS, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements (Continued) December 31, 2022 , January 1, 2022 and January 2, 2021 \\u200b (k) Revenue Recognition Revenues are recognized when our performance obligation is satisfied. Our primary performance obligation is satisfied when products are shipped. We report all amounts billed to a customer in a sale transaction as revenue, including those amounts related to shipping and handling. Shipping and handling costs are included in cost of goods sold. Consideration from a vendor to a retailer is presumed to be a reduction to the selling prices of the vendor’s products and, therefore, is characterized as a reduction of sales when recognized in the vendor’s income statement. As a result, coupon incentives, slotting and promotional expenses are recorded as a reduction of sales. Additionally, certain payments to customers related to in-store display incentives, or marketing development funds, are also recorded as a reduction of sales.(l) Selling, General and Administrative Expenses We promote our products with advertising, consumer incentives and trade promotions. These programs include, but are not limited to, discounts, slotting fees, coupons, rebates, in-store display incentives and volume-based incentives. Consumer incentive and trade promotion activities are recorded as a reduction to revenues based on amounts estimated as being due to customers and consumers at the end of a period. We base these estimates principally on historical utilization and redemption rates. We expense our advertising costs either in the period the advertising first takes place or as incurred. Advertising expenses were approximately $ 5.2 million, $ 7.2 million and $ 10.6 million, for fiscal 2022, 2021 and 2020, respectively.(m) Pension Plans We maintain four company-sponsored defined benefit pension plans covering approximately 23.9 % of our employees. Our funding policy is to contribute annually the amount recommended by our actuaries. From time to time, however, we voluntarily contribute greater amounts based on pension asset performance, tax considerations and other relevant factors.(n) Share-Based Compensation Expense We provide compensation benefits in the form of performance share long-term incentive awards (LTIAs), restricted stock, common stock and stock options to employees and non-employee directors. The cost of share-based compensation is recorded at fair value at the date of grant and expensed in our consolidated statements of operations over the requisite service period, if any.Performance share LTIAs granted to our executive officers and certain other members of senior management entitle each participant to earn shares of common stock upon the attainment of certain performance goals over the applicable performance period. The recognition of compensation expense for the performance share LTIAs is initially based on the probable outcome of the performance condition based on the fair value of the award on the date of grant and the anticipated number of shares to be awarded on a straight-line basis over the applicable performance period. The fair value of the awards on the date of grant is determined based upon the closing price of our common stock on the applicable measurement dates (i.e., the deemed grant dates for accounting purposes) reduced by the present value of expected dividends using the risk-free interest-rate as the award holders are not entitled to dividends or dividend equivalents during the vesting period. Our company’s performance against the defined performance goals are re-evaluated on a quarterly basis throughout the applicable performance period and the recognition of compensation expense is adjusted for subsequent changes in the estimated or actual outcome. The cumulative effect of a change in the estimated number of shares of common stock to be issued in respect of performance share awards is recognized as an adjustment to earnings in the period of the revision.The fair value of stock option awards is estimated on the date of grant using the Black-Scholes option pricing model and is recognized in expense over the vesting period of the options using the straight-line method. The Black-Scholes option pricing model requires various assumptions, including the expected volatility of our stock, the expected term of the option, the risk-free interest rate and the expected dividend yield. Expected volatility is based on both historical and implied volatilities of our common stock over the estimated expected term of the award. The risk-free rate for the expected term of the option is based on the U.S. Treasury yield curve in effect at the time of grant. All stock - 64 -B&G FOODS, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements (Continued) December 31, 2022 , January 1, 2022 and January 2, 2021 \\u200b option grants have an exercise price equal to or greater than the fair market value of our common stock on the date of grant and have a 10-year term. Employee stock options generally cliff vest three years after the date of grant and non-employee director stock options generally vest one year after the date of grant.We recognize compensation expense for only that portion of share-based awards that are expected to vest. We utilize historical employee termination behavior to determine our estimated forfeiture rates. If the actual forfeitures differ from those estimated by management, adjustments to compensation expense will be made in future periods.(o) Income Tax Expense Estimates and Policies Income taxes are accounted for under the asset and liability method. Deferred tax assets and liabilities of our company are recognized for the future tax consequences attributable to differences between the financial statement carrying amounts of existing assets and liabilities and their respective tax bases and operating loss and tax credit carryforwards. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured using enacted tax rates expected to apply to taxable income in the years in which those temporary differences are expected to be recovered or settled. A valuation allowance is provided when it is more likely than not that all or some portion of the deferred tax asset will not be realized. The effect on deferred tax assets and liabilities of a change in tax rates is recognized in operations in the period that includes the enactment date.As part of the income tax provision process of preparing our consolidated financial statements, we are required to estimate our income taxes. This process involves estimating our current tax expenses together with assessing temporary differences resulting from differing treatment of items for tax and accounting purposes. These differences result in deferred tax assets and liabilities. We then assess the likelihood that our deferred tax assets will be recovered from future taxable income and to the extent we believe the recovery is not likely, we establish a valuation allowance. Further, to the extent that we establish a valuation allowance or increase this allowance in a financial accounting period, we include such charge in our tax provision, or reduce our tax benefits in our consolidated statements of operations. We use our judgment to determine our provision or benefit for income taxes, deferred tax assets and liabilities and any valuation allowance recorded against our deferred tax assets.There are various factors that may cause these tax assumptions to change in the near term, and we may have to record a valuation allowance against our deferred tax assets. We cannot predict whether future U.S. federal and state income tax laws and regulations might be passed that could have a material effect on our results of operations. See Note 10, “Income Taxes,” for a discussion of the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act enacted in December 2017, which we refer to in this report as the “U.S. Tax Act,” as well as the Coronavirus Aid, Relief and Economic Security Act enacted in March 2020, which we refer to in this report as the “U.S. CARES Act.” We assess the impact of significant changes to the U.S. federal, state and international income tax laws and regulations on a regular basis and update the assumptions and estimates used to prepare our consolidated financial statements when new regulations and legislation are enacted. We recognize the benefit of an uncertain tax position that we have taken or expect to take on our income tax returns if it is “more likely than not” that such tax position will be sustained based on its technical merits. (p) Dividends Cash dividends, if any, are accrued as a liability on our consolidated balance sheets when declared and recorded as a decrease to additional paid-in capital, or as a decrease to retained earnings when additional paid-in capital has a zero balance.(q) Earnings Per Share Basic earnings per share is calculated by dividing net income by the weighted average number of shares of common stock outstanding. Diluted earnings per share is calculated by dividing net income by the weighted average number of shares of common stock outstanding plus all additional shares of common stock that would have been outstanding if potentially dilutive shares of common stock had been issued upon the exercise of stock options or in connection with performance share LTIAs that may be earned as of the beginning of the period using the treasury stock method.- 65 -B&G FOODS, INC.

(2) For fiscal 2021 and 2020, outstanding stock options of 487,395 and 739,976 , respectively, were excluded from diluted earnings per share as their effect was antidilutive.  (r) Accounting Standards Adopted in Fiscal 2022 or Fiscal 2021 In December 2019, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) issued a new Accounting Standards Update (ASU) that removes certain exceptions for recognizing deferred taxes for certain investments, performing intraperiod allocation and calculating income taxes in interim periods. The ASU also adds guidance to reduce complexity in certain areas, including recognizing deferred taxes for goodwill and allocating taxes to members of a consolidated group. This guidance became effective during the first quarter of 2021. The adoption of this ASU did not have a material impact to our consolidated financial statements or related disclosures.(s) Recently Issued Accounting Standards – Pending Adoption In October 2021, the FASB issued a new ASU which provides an exception to fair value measurement for revenue contracts acquired in business combinations. This ASU is effective for annual and interim periods in fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2022. We currently expect to adopt the standard during fiscal 2023 for any business combinations that occur in fiscal 2023 or after. Currently, we do not expect the adoption of this ASU to have a material impact to our consolidated financial statements.In March 2020, the FASB issued a new ASU which provides optional guidance for a limited time to ease the potential accounting burden associated with transitioning away from reference rates such as LIBOR. In December 2022, the FASB issued an ASU that extends the period of time preparers can utilize the reference rate reform relief guidance, so the FASB has deferred the sunset date of Topic 848 from December 31, 2022 to December 31, 2024. We are in the process of evaluating the impact of the adoption of this ASU. LIBOR is used to determine interest under our revolving credit facility and our tranche B term loans due 2026. Currently, however, we do not expect the adoption of this ASU to have a material impact to our consolidated financial statements. (3) Acquisitions and Divestitures ', ' On May 5, 2022, we completed the acquisition of the frozen vegetable manufacturing operations of Growers Express, LLC, whose primary business at the time of the acquisition was co-manufacturing certain Green Giant frozen vegetable products, including Green Giant ® Riced Veggies and Green Giant Veggie Spirals ®. The purchased assets include inventory, equipment, a sublease for a portion of a manufacturing facility in Yuma, Arizona, and a lease for a warehouse facility in San Luis, Arizona.

We refer to this divestiture as the “ Back to Nature sale.”During fiscal 2022, we reclassified $ 157.7 million of assets related to our Back to Nature business as assets held for sale. We measured the assets held for sale at the lower of their carrying value or fair value less anticipated costs to sell and recorded pre-tax, non-cash impairment charges of $ 103.6 million during the third quarter of 2022.

We expect to recognize $ 20.8 million of amortization expense in each of the fiscal years 2023 , 2024 and 2025, $ 20.1 million in fiscal 2026 and $ 15.3 million in fiscal 2027, respectively. See Note 3, “Acquisitions and Divestitures.” We completed our annual impairment tests for fiscal 2022, fiscal 2021 and fiscal 2020 with no adjustments to the carrying values of goodwill. Our testing indicates that the implied fair value of our company is in excess of the carrying value. However, a change in the cash flow assumptions could result in an impairment of goodwill.We completed our annual impairment tests for fiscal 2022 and fiscal 2020 with no adjustments to the carrying values of indefinite-lived intangible assets. However, in connection with our decision to sell the Back to Nature business, during fiscal 2022 we reclassified $ 109.9 million of indefinite-lived trademark intangible assets, $ 29.5 million of goodwill, $ 11.0 million of finite-lived customer relationship intangible assets and $ 7.3 million of inventories to assets held for sale. We measured the assets held for sale at the lower of their carrying value or fair value less anticipated costs to sell and recorded pre-tax, non-cash impairment charges of $ 106.4 million during fiscal 2022 relating to those assets. See Note 3, “Acquisitions and Divestiture” and Note 18, “Subsequent Events.”In addition, our annual impairment tests for fiscal 2021 resulted in our company recording non-cash impairment charges to trademarks for the Static Guard , SnackWell’s , Molly McButter and Farmwise brands of $ 23.1 million in the aggregate during the fourth quarter of fiscal 2021, which is recorded in “Impairment of intangible assets” in the accompanying consolidated statement of operations for fiscal 2021. We partially impaired the Static Guard and Molly McButter brands, and we fully impaired the SnackWell’s and Farmwise brands, which have been discontinued. Certain Farmwise branded products have been transitioned to the Green Giant brand.If operating results for the Static Guard and Molly McButter brands continue to deteriorate, or if operating results for any of our other brands, including newly acquired brands, deteriorate, at rates in excess of our current projections, we may be required to record additional non-cash impairment charges to certain intangible assets. In addition, any significant decline in our market capitalization or changes in discount rates, even if due to macroeconomic factors, could put pressure on the carrying value of our goodwill. A determination that all or a portion of our goodwill or indefinite-lived intangible assets are impaired, although a non-cash charge to operations, could have a material adverse effect on our business, consolidated financial condition and results of operations.

       "dict_values(['\\n\\nWe could be subject to adverse publicity or claims from consumers. \\n\\nCertain of our products contain ingredients which are the subject of public scrutiny, including the suggestion that consumption may have adverse health effects. Although we strive to respond to consumer preferences and social expectations, we may not be successful in these efforts. An unfavorable report on the effects of ingredients present in our products, product recalls, such as the Jif peanut butter product recall, or negative publicity or litigation could influence consumer preferences, significantly reduce the demand for our products, and adversely affect our profitability. \\n\\nWe may also be subject to complaints from or litigation by consumers who allege food and beverage-related illness, or other quality, health, or operational concerns. Adverse publicity resulting from such allegations could materially adversely affect us, regardless of whether such allegations are true or whether we are ultimately held liable. A lawsuit or claim could result in an adverse decision against us, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, and results of operations. \\n\\nChanges in tax, environmental, or other regulations and laws, or their application, or failure to comply with existing licensing, trade, and other regulations and laws could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition. \\n\\nWe are subject to income and other taxes, primarily in the U.S. and Canada, based upon the jurisdictions in which our sales and profits are determined to be earned and taxed. Federal, state, and foreign statutory income tax rates and taxing regimes have been subject to significant change and continue to evolve. Our interpretation of current tax laws and their applicability to our business, as well as any changes to existing laws, can significantly impact our effective income tax rate and deferred tax balances. In particular, proposals brought forth by the U.S. presidential administration include increases to federal income tax rates that, if enacted, could have a material impact to our financial results. We are also subject to regular reviews, examinations, and audits by the Internal Revenue Service (the “IRS”) and other taxing authorities with respect to taxes within and outside of the U.S. Although we believe our tax estimates are reasonable, the final outcome of tax controversies could result in material incremental tax liabilities, including interest and penalties. Our effective income tax rate is also influenced by the geography, timing, nature, and magnitude of transactions, such as acquisitions and divestitures, restructuring activities, and impairment charges. Further, we continue to monitor The Inflation Reduction Act of 2022, H.R. 5376 (the “Inflation Reduction Act”) and related regulatory developments to evaluate their potential impact on our business, tax rate, and financial results. \\n\\nOur operations are subject to various regulations and laws, in addition to tax laws, administered by federal, state, and local government agencies in the U.S., including the FDA, U.S. Federal Trade Commission, the U.S. Departments of Agriculture, Commerce, and Labor, state regulatory agencies, and other agencies, as well as to regulations and laws administered by government agencies in Canada and other countries in which we have operations and our products are sold. In particular, the manufacturing, marketing, transportation, storage, distribution, and sale of food products are each subject to governmental regulation that is increasingly extensive. Governmental regulation encompasses such matters as ingredients (including whether a product contains bioengineered ingredients), packaging, labeling, pricing, advertising, relations with distributors and retailers, health, safety, data privacy and security, and anti-corruption, as well as an increased focus regarding environmental policies relating to climate change, regulating greenhouse gas emissions, energy policies, and sustainability, including single-use plastics. Additionally, we are routinely subject to new or modified securities regulations, other laws and regulations, and accounting and reporting standards. \\n\\nIn the U.S., we are required to comply with federal laws, such as the Food, Drug and Cosmetic Act, the Food Safety Modernization Act, the Occupational Safety and Health Act, the Clean Air Act, the Clean Water Act, the Resource Conservation and Recovery Act, the Tariff Act, laws governing equal employment opportunity, and various other federal statutes and regulations. \\n\\nWe are also subject to various laws and regulations that are continuously evolving in the U.S. and other jurisdictions regarding privacy, data protection, and data security, including those related to the collection, storage, handling, use, disclosure, transfer, and security of personal data. For example, in the U.S., the California Consumer Privacy Act (the “CCPA”) imposes requirements on companies that do business in California and collect personal information from certain individuals, providing civil penalties for companies that fail to comply with these requirements as well as a private right of action for data breaches. Further, the California Privacy Rights Act, which took effect January 1, 2023, builds on the CCPA requiring the establishment of a dedicated agency to regulate privacy issues. Similarly, Virginia, Colorado, Connecticut, and Utah have all adopted laws that take effect in calendar year 2023, introducing new privacy obligations that will require developing additional compliance mechanisms and processes. There also is a wide range of enforcement agencies at both state and federal levels that can review companies for privacy and data security concerns based on general consumer protection laws. Accordingly, failure to comply with federal and state laws regarding privacy and security of personal information could expose us to fines and penalties under such laws. \\n\\nComplying with new regulations and laws, or changes to existing regulations and laws, or their application could increase our costs or adversely affect our sales of certain products. In addition, our failure or inability to comply with applicable regulations and laws could subject us to civil remedies, including fines, injunctions, recalls or seizures, and potential criminal sanctions, which could have a material adverse effect on our business and financial condition. \\n\\nOur operations in certain developing markets expose us to regulatory risks. \\n\\nIn many countries outside of the U.S., particularly in those with developing economies, it may be common for others to engage in business practices prohibited by laws and regulations applicable to us, such as the U.S. Foreign Corrupt Practices Act or similar local anti-bribery or anti-corruption laws. These laws generally prohibit companies and their employees, contractors, or agents from making improper payments to government officials for the purpose of obtaining or retaining business. Failure to comply with these laws could subject us to civil and criminal penalties that could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations. In addition, the enforcement of remedies in foreign jurisdictions may be less certain, resulting in varying abilities to enforce intellectual property and contractual rights. \\n\\nRisks associated with climate change and other environmental impacts or legal, regulatory, or market measures to address climate change may negatively affect our business and operations. \\n\\nAs set forth in the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change Sixth Assessment Report, global average temperatures are gradually increasing due to increased concentration of carbon dioxide and other greenhouse gases in the atmosphere, which have contributed to and are expected to continue contributing to significant changes in weather patterns around the globe and an increase in the frequency and severity of extreme weather and natural disasters. In the event that climate change has a negative effect on agricultural productivity, we may be subject to decreased availability or less favorable pricing for certain commodities that are necessary for our products, such as green coffee, protein meals, peanuts, grains, plastic containers, oils and fats, fruit, and other ingredients. We may also be subjected to decreased availability or less favorable pricing for water or energy as a result of such change, which could impact our manufacturing and distribution operations. In addition, natural disasters and extreme weather conditions may disrupt the productivity of our facilities or the operation of our supply chain, which could increase our insurance or other operating costs or require us to make additional, unplanned capital expenditures. Specifically, in 2022, Hurricane Ida caused our coffee manufacturing facilities in New Orleans, Louisiana to be temporarily shut down, and in 2021, unforeseen weather events in Texas, Oklahoma, and Kansas temporarily shut down our pet manufacturing facilities in Kansas. Although we consider these to be uncommon events and we were able to effectively minimize any disruptions through our business continuity planning efforts, extreme weather could disrupt our production in the future, adversely affecting our ability to meet customer deadlines and supply demands. \\n\\nAdditionally, there is an increased focus by foreign, federal, state, and local regulatory and legislative bodies regarding environmental policies relating to climate change, regulating greenhouse gas emissions, energy policies, and sustainability, including single-use plastics. Increased energy or compliance costs and expenses due to the impacts of climate change and additional legal or regulatory requirements regarding climate change designed to reduce or mitigate the effects of carbon dioxide and other greenhouse gas emissions on the environment could be costly and may cause disruptions in, or an increase in the costs associated with, our manufacturing and distribution facilities, as well as increase supply chain costs. Moreover, compliance with any such legal or regulatory requirements may require us to make significant changes to our business operations, strategy, and reporting, which will likely require substantial time, attention, and costs. \\n\\nFinally, we might fail to effectively address increased attention from the media, shareholders, activists, and other stakeholders on climate change and related environmental sustainability matters. Such failure, or the perception that we have failed to act \\n\\nresponsibly with respect to such matters or to effectively respond to new or additional regulatory requirements regarding climate change, whether or not valid, could result in adverse publicity and negatively affect our business and reputation. In addition, from time to time we establish and publicly announce goals and commitments, including goals to reduce our impact on the environment. For example, in 2022, we established science-based targets for Scope 1, 2, and 3 greenhouse gas emissions. Our ability to achieve any stated goal, target, or objective is subject to numerous factors and conditions, many of which are outside of our control, including evolving regulatory requirements and the availability of suppliers that can meet our sustainability and other standards. Furthermore, standards for tracking and reporting such matters continue to evolve. Our selection of voluntary disclosure frameworks and standards, and the interpretation or application of those frameworks and standards, may change from time to time or differ from those of others. Methodologies for reporting this data may be updated and previously reported data may be adjusted to reflect improvement in availability and quality of third-party data, changing assumptions, changes in the nature and scope of our operations (including from acquisitions and divestitures), and other changes in circumstances, which could result in significant revisions to our current goals, reported progress in achieving such goals, or ability to achieve such goals in the future. If we fail to achieve, are perceived to have failed, or are delayed in achieving these goals and commitments, it could negatively affect consumer preference for our products or investor confidence in our stock, as well as expose us to government enforcement actions and private litigation. \\n\\nThe physical effects and transitional costs of climate change and legal, regulatory, or market initiatives to address climate change could have a negative impact on our business, financial condition, and results of operations. \\n\\nGeneral Risk Factors \\n\\nWe may be unable to grow market share of our products. \\n\\nWe operate in the competitive food industry whose growth potential is positively correlated to population growth. Our success depends in part on our ability to grow our brands faster than the population in general. We consider our ability to build and sustain the equity of our brands critical to our market share growth. If we do not succeed in these efforts, our market share growth may slow, which could have a material impact on our results of operations.  \\n\\nIf our information technology systems fail to perform adequately or we are unable to protect such information technology systems against data corruption, cyber-based attacks, or network security breaches, our operations could be disrupted, and we may suffer financial damage or loss because of lost or misappropriated information. \\n\\nWe rely on information technology networks and systems, including the Internet, to process, transmit, and store electronic information, and the importance of such networks and systems has increased due to many of our employees working remotely. In particular, we depend on our information technology infrastructure to effectively manage our business data, supply chain, logistics, finance, manufacturing, and other business processes and for digital marketing activities and electronic communications between Company personnel and our customers and suppliers. If we do not allocate and effectively manage the resources necessary to build, sustain, and protect an appropriate technology infrastructure, or we do not effectively implement system upgrades, our business or financial results could be negatively impacted. We are regularly the target of attempted cyber and other security threats. Therefore, we continuously monitor and update our information technology networks and infrastructure to prevent, detect, address, and mitigate the risk of unauthorized access, misuse, computer viruses, phishing attacks, malware, ransomware, social engineering, password theft, physical breaches, and other events that could have a security impact. In addition, the ongoing conflict between Russia and Ukraine has heightened the risk of cyberattacks. We invest in industry standard security technology to protect our data and business processes against the risk of data security breaches and cyber-based attacks. We believe our security technology tools and processes provide adequate measures of protection against security breaches and in reducing cybersecurity risks. Nevertheless, despite continued vigilance in these areas, security breaches or system failures of our infrastructure, whether due to attacks by hackers, employee error, or other causes, can create system disruptions, shutdowns, transaction errors, or unauthorized disclosure of confidential information. If we are unable to prevent such breaches or failures, our operations could be disrupted, or we may suffer financial damage or loss because of lost or misappropriated information. In addition, the cost to remediate any damages to our information technology systems suffered as a result of a cyber-based attack could be significant. \\n\\nFurther, we have outsourced several information technology support services and administrative functions, including benefit plan administration and other functions, to third-party service providers, and may outsource other functions in the future to achieve cost savings and efficiencies. In addition, certain of our processes rely on third-party cloud computing services. If the service providers to which we outsource these functions do not perform effectively, we may not be able to achieve the \\n\\nexpected benefits and may have to incur additional costs to correct errors made by such service providers. Depending on the function involved, such errors may also lead to business disruption, processing inefficiencies, inaccurate financial reporting, the loss of or damage to intellectual property through security breach, the loss of sensitive data through security breach, or otherwise. \\n\\nWe may face complications with the design or implementation of our new enterprise performance management system, which may negatively affect our business and operations. \\n\\nWe rely on information technology networks and systems to manage our business and operations. We are in the process of a multi-year implementation of a new enterprise performance management (“EPM”) system, inclusive of an enterprise resource planning system (i.e., general ledger), through the use of Oracle Cloud Solutions. The EPM system will replace our existing financial system and is designed to accurately maintain our financial records, enhance operational functionality and efficiency, and provide timely information to our management team. The EPM system implementation process has required, and will continue to require, the investment of significant personnel and financial resources over the duration of the project. We anticipate full integration of the EPM system by the end of 2025. Further, we may not be able to successfully implement the EPM system without experiencing delays, increased costs, and other complications. If we are unable to successfully design and implement the new EPM system as planned, our financial condition, results of operations, and cash flows could be negatively impacted. In addition, if the EPM system does not operate as intended, the effectiveness of our internal controls over financial reporting could be negatively affected. \\n\\nThe ongoing conflict between Russia and Ukraine and the related disruptions to the global economy could adversely affect our business, financial condition, or results of operations. \\n\\nThe global economy has been negatively impacted by the ongoing conflict between Russia and Ukraine. Governments in the United States, United Kingdom, and European Union have imposed sanctions on certain products, industry sectors, and parties in Russia. Although we do not have any operations in Russia or Ukraine, we have experienced and may continue to experience shortages in materials and increased costs for transportation, energy, and raw materials due in part to the negative impact of the conflict on the global economy. If the conflict continues for an extended period of time, it could result in cyberattacks, supply chain disruptions, lower consumer demand, changes in foreign exchange rates, increased trade barriers and restrictions on global trade, and other impacts, which may adversely affect our business, financial condition, or results of operations. These and other impacts of the ongoing conflict between Russia and Ukraine could also heighten many of the other risk factors discussed in this section. \\n\\n'])"

BEYOND MEAT, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements Note 1. Introduction The Company Beyond Meat, Inc., a Delaware corporation (including its subsidiaries unless the context otherwise requires, the “Company”), is a leading plant-based meat company offering a portfolio of revolutionary plant-based meats. The Company builds meat directly from plants, an innovation that enables consumers to experience the taste, texture and other sensory attributes of popular animal-based meat products while enjoying the nutritional and environmental benefits of eating the Company’s plant-based meat products. The Company’s brand promise, “Eat What You Love,” represents a strong belief that there is a better way to feed our future and that the positive choices we all make, no matter how small, can have a great impact on our personal health and the health of our planet. By shifting from animal-based meat to plant-based meat, we can positively impact four growing global issues: human health, climate change, constraints on natural resources and animal welfare. On September 7, 2018, the Company changed its name from Savage River, Inc. to Beyond Meat, Inc. On January 14, 2020, the Company registered its subsidiary, Beyond Meat EU B.V., in the Netherlands. On April 28, 2020, the Company registered its subsidiary, Beyond Meat (Jiaxing) Food Co., Ltd. (“BYND JX”), in the Zhejiang Province in China. On June 17, 2021, the Company incorporated its subsidiary, Beyond Meat Canada Inc., in Canada. On January 25, 2021, the Company entered into the Planet Partnership, LLC, a joint venture with PepsiCo, Inc., to develop, produce and market innovative snack and beverage products made from plant-based protein. The Company’s primary production facilities are located in Columbia, Missouri, and Devault, Pennsylvania, and its research and development and administrative offices are located in El Segundo, California. The Company owns a manufacturing facility in Enschede, the Netherlands, where it produces its woven protein and dry blend flavor systems for shipment to local co-manufacturers, including one of the Company’s distributors who built a co-manufacturing facility in the Netherlands used for production of the Company’s finished goods. In Jiaxing, China, the Company leases a manufacturing facility, where it produces its woven protein and houses end-to-end production. Renovations in the leased facility were substantially completed and trial production began in the first quarter of 2021. In the second quarter of 2021, several commercial trials of certain of the Company’s manufacturing processes were completed. Following the successful qualification of extrusion production capabilities in the third quarter of 2021 and the completion of International Food Safety System Certification (FSSC) 22000 and ISA Halal certification in the fourth quarter of 2021, the facility completed commercialization of end-to-end production at the end of 2021. In the fourth quarter of 2021, the Company also leased a facility in Shanghai, China, which is used as a local research and development facility to support the Company’s local manufacturing operations. In addition to its own production facilities, the Company uses co-manufacturers in various locations in the United States, Canada, the Netherlands and China. In the third quarter of 2021, the Company completed the purchase of a facility in Columbia, Missouri, which is used primarily for warehousing and dry blending (ingredient handling). In the third quarter of 2021, the Company also assumed an operating lease for a building in Commerce, California to house its commercialization center. Subsequent to the year ended December 31, 2022, on February 14, 2023, the Company terminated this lease. In addition to leasing its corporate headquarters and other general office space in El Segundo, California, the Company also leases a facility for its former Manhattan Beach Project Innovation Center in El Segundo, California. On January 14, 2021, the Company entered into a lease agreement to house its corporate headquarters, lab and innovation space in El Segundo, California. In 2022, upon completion of the Phase1-A of the new BEYOND MEAT, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements (continued)  campus facility in El Segundo, the Company moved its Innovation team from the Manhattan Beach Project Innovation Center to the new campus facility. The Company sells to a variety of customers in the retail and foodservice channels throughout the United States and internationally primarily through distributors who purchase, store, sell, and deliver the Company’s products. In addition, the Company sells directly to customers in the retail and foodservice channels who handle their own distribution. As of December 31, 2022, approximately 84 % of the Company’s assets were located in the United States. Initial Public Offering On May 6, 2019, the Company completed its initial public offering (“IPO”) of common stock in which it sold 11,068,750 shares. The shares began trading on the Nasdaq Global Select Market on May 2, 2019. The shares were sold at a public offering price of $ 25.00 per share for net proceeds of approximately $ 252.4 million, after deducting underwriting discounts and commissions of $ 19.4 million and issuance costs of approximately $ 4.9 million payable by the Company. Upon the closing of the IPO, all outstanding shares of the Company’s convertible preferred stock automatically converted into 41,562,111 shares of common stock on a one -for-one basis, and warrants exercisable for convertible preferred stock were automatically converted into warrants exercisable for a total of 160,767 shares of common stock. Secondary Public Offering On August 5, 2019, the Company completed a secondary public offering (“Secondary Offering”) of common stock in which it sold 250,000 shares and the selling stockholders sold 3,487,500 shares. The shares were sold at a public offering price of $ 160.00 per share for net proceeds to the Company of approximately $ 37.4 million, after deducting underwriting discounts and commissions of $ 1.5 million and issuance costs of approximately $ 1.1 million payable by the Company. Total Secondary Offering issuance costs paid in 2019 were approximately $ 2.2 million, of which approximately $ 1.1 million was capitalized to reflect the costs associated with the issuance of new shares and offset against proceeds from the Secondary Offering. The Company did not receive any proceeds from the sale of common stock by the selling stockholders. COVID-19 Pandemic On March 11, 2020, the World Health Organization declared COVID-19 a pandemic. The global spread and unprecedented impact of COVID-19 continues to create significant volatility, uncertainty and economic disruption. The Company’s operations and its financial results including net revenues, gross profit, gross margin and operating expenses were negatively impacted by COVID-19 in 2020, 2021 and, to a lesser extent, 2022. The extent of COVID-19’s effect on the Company’s operational and financial performance will depend on future developments, including the duration, spread and intensity of the pandemic (including any resurgences), the impact of variants of the virus that causes COVID-19, the wide distribution and public acceptance of COVID-19 vaccines, labor needs at the Company as well as in the supply chain and at customers, compliance with government or employer COVID-19 vaccine mandates and the resulting impact on available labor, and the level of social and economic restrictions imposed in the United States and abroad in an effort to curb the spread of the virus, all of which are uncertain and difficult to predict considering the rapidly evolving landscape. As a result, it is not currently possible to ascertain the overall impact of COVID-19 on the Company’s business, results of operations, financial condition or liquidity. Future events and effects related to the COVID-19 pandemic cannot be determined with precision and actual results could significantly differ from estimates or forecasts. Emerging Growth Company Status Upon the completion of the Company’s IPO, the Company elected to be an Emerging Growth Company (“EGC”), as defined in the Jumpstart Our Business Startups Act (“JOBS Act”). Effective December 31, 2020, the Company lost its EGC status and is now categorized as a Large Accelerated Filer based upon the current BEYOND MEAT, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements (continued)  market capitalization of the Company according to Rule 12b-2 of the Exchange Act. As a result, the Company must comply with all financial disclosure and governance requirements applicable to Large Accelerated Filers. Note 2. Summary of Significant Accounting Policies Basis of Presentation The consolidated financial statements have been prepared in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America (“GAAP”), and include the accounts of the Company and its subsidiaries. All intercompany balances and transactions have been eliminated. Certain amounts in the consolidated financial statements of prior years have been reclassified to conform to the current year presentation. Fiscal Year The Company operates on a fiscal calendar year, and each interim quarter is comprised of one 5-week period and two 4-week periods, with each week ending on a Saturday. The Company’s fiscal year always begins on January 1 and ends on December 31. As a result, the Company’s first and fourth fiscal quarters may have more or fewer days included than a traditional 91-day fiscal quarter. Segment Information The Company has one operating segment and one reportable segment, as the Company’s chief operating decision maker, who is the Company’s Chief Executive Officer, reviews financial information on an aggregate basis for purposes of allocating resources and evaluating financial performance. Management’s Use of Estimates The preparation of financial statements in conformity with GAAP requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect certain reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period. Significant accounting estimates made by the Company include trade promotion accruals; useful lives of property, plant and equipment; valuation of deferred tax assets; valuation of inventory; incremental borrowing rate used to determine operating lease right-of-use assets and operating lease liabilities; assessment of contract-based factors, asset-based factors, entity-based factors and market-based factors to determine the lease term impacting right-of-use assets and lease liabilities; the valuation of the fair value of stock options used to determine share-based compensation expense; the valuation of the fair value of common stock and preferred stock used in the remeasurement of warrants and liabilities; and loss contingency accruals in connection with claims, lawsuits and administrative proceedings. These estimates and assumptions are based on current facts, historical experience and various other factors believed to be reasonable under the circumstances, the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities and the recording of expenses that are not readily apparent from other sources. Actual results could differ from those estimates and such differences may be material to the financial statements. Comprehensive Loss Comprehensive loss includes unrealized gains (losses) on the Company’s foreign currency translation adjustments for the years ended December 31, 2022, 2021 and 2020. Income taxes on the unrealized losses are not material. Convertible Senior Notes On March 5, 2021, the Company issued $ 1.0 billion aggregate principal amount of its 0 % Convertible Senior Notes due 2027 (the “Convertible Notes”) in a private placement to qualified institutional buyers pursuant to Rule 144A under the Securities Act. On March 12, 2021, the initial purchasers of the Convertible Notes exercised their option to purchase an additional $ 150.0 million aggregate principal amount of the Company’s BEYOND MEAT, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements (continued)  0 % Convertible Senior Notes due 2027 (the “Additional Notes”, and together with the Convertible Notes, the “Notes”), and such Additional Notes were issued on March 16, 2021. See Note 7 . The Company accounts for the Notes under Accounting Standards Update (“ASU”) No. 2020-06, “Debt with Conversion and Other Options (Subtopic 470-20) and Derivatives and Hedging—Contracts in Entity’s Own Equity” (ASU 2020-06”), which the Company early adopted in the first quarter of 2021 concurrent with the issuance of the Notes. The Company records the Notes in “Long-term liabilities” at face value net of issuance costs. If any of the conditions to the convertibility of the Notes is satisfied, or the Notes become due within one year, then the Company may be required under applicable accounting standards to reclassify the liability carrying value of the Notes as a current, rather than a long-term, liability. Capped Call Transactions Capped call transactions cover the aggregate number of shares of the Company’s common stock that will initially underlie the Notes, and generally reduce potential dilution to the Company’s common stock upon any conversion of Notes and/or offset any cash payments the Company may make in excess of the principal amount of the converted Notes, as the case may be, with such reduction and/or offset subject to a cap, based on the cap price of the capped call transactions. The Company determined that the freestanding capped call option contracts qualify as equity under the accounting guidance on indexation and equity classification, and recognized the contract by recording an entry to “Additional paid-in capital” (“APIC”) in stockholders’ equity in its consolidated balance sheet. The Company also determined that the capped call option contracts meet the definition of a derivative under Accounting Standards Codification (“ASC”) Topic 815, “Derivatives and Hedging” (“ASC 815”), but are not required to be accounted for as a derivative as they meet the scope exception outlined in ASC 815. Instead the capped call options are recorded in APIC and not remeasured. Issuance Costs Issuance costs related to the Notes offering were capitalized and offset against proceeds from the Notes. Issuance costs consist of legal and other costs related to the issuance of the Notes and are amortized to interest expense over the term of the Notes. Total issuance costs capitalized in the year ended December 31, 2021 were approximately $ 23.6 million, of which none remained unpaid as of December 31, 2021. There were $ 16.4 million and $ 20.3 million in unamortized issuance costs related to the Notes as of December 31, 2022 and 2021, respectively. Foreign Currency The Company’s foreign entities use their local currency as the functional currency. For these entities, the Company translates net assets into U.S. dollars at period end exchange rates, while revenue and expense accounts are translated at average exchange rates prevailing during the periods being reported. Resulting currency translation adjustments are included in “Accumulated other comprehensive income” and foreign currency transaction gains and losses are included in “Other, net.” Transaction gains and losses on long-term intra-entity transactions are recorded as a component of “Other comprehensive loss.” Transactions denominated in a currency other than the reporting entity’s functional currency may give rise to transaction gains and losses that impact the Company’s results of operations. Foreign currency translation loss, net of tax, reported as cumulative translation adjustments through “Other comprehensive loss” was $ 4.2 million and $ 2.3 million, respectively, in the years ended December 31, 2022 and 2021. Realized and unrealized foreign currency transaction (losses) gains included in “Other, net” were $( 4.9 ) million, $( 0.2 ) million and $ 0.2 million, respectively, in the years ended December 31, 2022, 2021 and 2020. BEYOND MEAT, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements (continued)  Fair Value of Financial Instruments The fair value measurement accounting guidance creates a fair value hierarchy to prioritize the inputs used to measure fair value into three categories. A financial instrument’s level within the fair value hierarchy is based on the lowest level of input significant to the fair value measurement, where Level 1 is the highest and Level 3 is the lowest. The three levels are defined as follows: • Level 1 —Unadjusted quoted prices in active markets accessible by the reporting entity for identical assets or liabilities. Active markets are those in which transactions for the asset or liability occur with sufficient frequency and volume to provide pricing information on an ongoing basis. • Level 2 —Quoted prices for similar instruments in active markets; quoted prices for identical or similar instruments in markets that are not active and model-derived valuations in which significant value drivers are observable. • Level 3 —Valuations derived from valuation techniques in which significant value drivers are unobservable. The Company’s financial instruments include cash equivalents, accounts receivable, accounts payable, and accrued expenses, for which the carrying amounts approximate fair value due to the short-term maturity of these financial instruments. The Company’s convertible notes are carried at face value less the unamortized debt issuance costs (see Note 7 ). The Company had no financial instruments measured at fair value on a recurring basis as of December 31, 2020, other than the liability classified share-settled obligation to one of the Company’s executive officers (see Note 9 ) which represented a Level 1 financial instrument. The executive officer separated from the Company effective August 27, 2021. As a result, the fourth quarterly tranche of the liability classified share-settled obligation was not earned and canceled. As of December 31, 2022 and 2021 no liability remained for this liability classified share-settled obligation. There were no transfers of financial assets or liabilities into or out of Level 1, Level 2 or Level 3 in the years ended December 31, 2022, 2021 or 2020. Cash and Cash Equivalents The Company maintains cash balances at three financial institutions in the United States. The cash balances may, at times, exceed federally insured limits. Accounts are guaranteed by the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation or FDIC up to $250,000. The Company considers all highly liquid investments with original maturity dates of 90 days or less to be cash equivalents. Cash equivalents include approximately 86 % in money market accounts with approximately 10 % in demand deposits and 4 % in restricted cash. Restricted Cash Restricted cash includes cash held as collateral for a stand-alone letter of credit agreement related to normal business transactions. This agreement requires the Company to maintain a specified amount of cash as collateral in a segregated account to support the letter of credit issued thereunder. Accounts Receivable The Company records accounts receivable at net realizable value. This value includes an appropriate allowance for estimated uncollectible accounts to reflect any anticipated losses on the accounts receivable balances and recorded in allowance for doubtful accounts. Allowance for doubtful accounts is calculated based on the Company’s history of write-offs, level of past due accounts, and relationships with and economic status of the Company’s distributors or customers. BEYOND MEAT, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements (continued)  The Company had $ 1.4 million and $ 1.3 million allowance for doubtful accounts as of December 31, 2022 and 2021, respectively. Inventories and Cost of Goods Sold Inventories are recorded at lower of cost or net realizable value. The Company accounts for inventory using the weighted average cost method. In addition to product cost, inventory costs include expenditures such as direct labor and certain supply and overhead expenses including in-bound shipping and handling costs incurred in bringing the inventory to its existing condition and location. Inventories are comprised primarily of raw materials, direct labor and overhead costs. Weighted average cost method is used to absorb raw materials, direct labor, and overhead into inventory. The Company reviews inventory quantities on hand and records a provision for excess and obsolete inventory based primarily on historical and forecasted demand, estimated shelf life of various raw materials and packaging, work in process and finished goods inventory, as well as the age of the inventory, among other factors. Property, Plant and Equipment Property, plant and equipment are carried at cost less accumulated depreciation and are depreciated using the straight-line method over the following estimated useful lives:  Land Not amortized Buildings 30 years Leasehold improvements Shorter of lease term or estimated useful life Furniture and fixtures 3 years Manufacturing equipment 5 to 10 years Research and development equipment 5 to 10 years Software and computer equipment 3 years Vehicles 5 years Leasehold improvements are depreciated on a straight-line basis over the lesser of the estimated useful life of the asset or the remaining lease term. When assets are sold or retired, the asset and related accumulated depreciation are removed from the respective account balances and any gain or loss on disposal is included in “Loss from operations.” Expenditures for repairs and maintenance are charged directly to expense when incurred. See Note 6 . Accounting for Acquisition ', 'The Company follows the guidance in ASC 805, “Business Combinations,” for determining whether an acquisition meets the definition of a business combination or asset acquisition. The acquired assets may include, but are not limited to land, building, building improvements, manufacturing equipment and assembled work force. ', \"For acquisitions that are accounted for as acquisitions of assets, the Company records the acquired tangible and intangible assets and assumed liabilities, if any, based on each asset’s and liability's relative fair value at the acquisition date to the total purchase price plus capitalized acquisition costs. The method for determining relative fair value varies depending on the type of asset. \", 'The Company has completed one acquisition to date. ', 'Impairment of Long-Lived Assets Long-lived assets, including property and equipment, are reviewed by management for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of the asset may not be fully recoverable. When events or circumstances indicate that impairment may be present, management evaluates BEYOND MEAT, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements (continued)  the probability that future undiscounted net cash flows received will be less than the carrying amount of the asset. If projected future undiscounted cash flows are less than the carrying value of an asset, then such assets are written down to their fair values. The Company concluded that no long-lived assets were impaired during the fiscal years ended December 31, 2022, 2021 and 2020. Income Taxes The Company is subject to federal and state income taxes. The Company uses the asset and liability method of accounting for income taxes as set forth in the authoritative guidance for accounting for income taxes. Under this method, the Company recognizes deferred tax assets and liabilities for the expected future tax consequences of temporary differences between the respective carrying amounts and tax basis of assets and liabilities. A valuation allowance is established against the portion of deferred tax assets that the Company believes will not be realized on a more likely than not basis. With respect to uncertain tax positions, the Company recognizes in its financial statements those tax positions determined to be more likely than not of being sustained upon examination, based on the technical merits of the positions. The Company’s policy is to recognize, when applicable, interest and penalties on uncertain tax positions as part of income tax expense. See Note 11 . Leases The Company leases certain equipment used for research and development and operations under both finance and operating lease agreements. An asset and a corresponding liability for the finance lease obligations are established for the cost of a finance lease. Finance lease assets are included in “Property, plant and equipment, net” in the Company’s consolidated balance sheets. Operating leases include lease arrangements for the Company’s corporate offices, the new Campus Lease (see Note 4 ), the former Manhattan Beach Project Innovation Center, manufacturing facilities, warehouses, vehicles and, to a lesser extent, equipment. Operating leases with a term greater than one year are recorded on the consolidated balance sheets as operating lease right-of-use assets and operating lease liabilities at the commencement date. Operating lease assets represent the right to use an underlying asset for the lease term, and operating lease liabilities represent the obligation to make lease payments arising from the lease. The Company records these balances initially at the present value of future minimum lease payments calculated using the Company’s incremental borrowing rate and expected lease term. The Company estimates the incremental borrowing rate for each operating lease based on prevailing market rates for collateralized debt in a similar economic environment with similar payment terms and maturity dates commensurate with the terms of the lease. Certain adjustments to the operating lease right-of-use assets may be required for items such as initial direct costs paid or incentives received. Certain leases contain variable payments, which are expensed as incurred and not included in the Company’s operating lease right-of-use assets and operating lease liabilities. These amounts primarily include payments for maintenance, utilities, taxes and insurance on the Company’s corporate, research and development, and manufacturing facilities and warehouse leases and are excluded from the present value of the Company’s lease obligations. Some leases also include early termination options, which can be exercised under specific conditions. The Company includes options to extend the lease term if the options are reasonably certain of being exercised. The Company does not have residual value guarantees or material restrictive covenants associated with its leases. Upon adoption of ASU 2016-02, the Company elected to combine lease and non-lease components on all new or modified leases into a single lease component, for all classes of assets other than the co-manufacturing class of assets, which the Company recognizes over the expected term on a straight-line expense basis. The Company elected to separate the lease and non-lease components on all new or modified operating leases for the co-manufacturing class of assets for the purpose of recording operating lease right-of-use assets and operating lease liabilities. Prior to fiscal 2020, the Company accounted for leases under ASC 840 and did not record operating leases on its consolidated balance sheets. See Note 4 . BEYOND MEAT, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements (continued)  When the Company purchases property that it was previously leasing under an operating lease, the Company de-recognizes the right-of-use asset and lease liability and recognizes the difference between the purchase price and the carrying amount of the lease liability immediately before the purchase as an adjustment to the carrying value of the asset. The Company allocates the purchase price to the assets acquired based upon their relative values. Contingencies The Company is subject to a range of claims, lawsuits, and administrative proceedings that arise in the ordinary course of business. The Company accrues a liability (which amount includes litigation costs expected to be incurred) and charges operations for such matters when it is probable that a liability has been incurred and the amount can be reasonably estimated, in accordance with the recognition criteria of the Financial Accounting Standards Board (“FASB”) ASC 450, Contingencies . Estimating liabilities and costs associated with these matters require significant judgment based upon the professional knowledge and experience of management and its legal counsel. See Note 10 . Revenue Recognition In May 2014, the FASB issued ASU No. 2014-09, “Revenue from Contracts with Customers” (“ASU 2014-09”), which, along with subsequent ASUs, amended the existing accounting standards for revenue recognition (“Topic 606”). This guidance is based on principles that govern the recognition of revenue at an amount an entity expects to be entitled to receive when products are transferred to customers. ASU 2014-09 was effective for the Company beginning January 1, 2019. The majority of the Company’s contracts with customers generally consist of a single performance obligation to transfer promised goods. Based on the Company’s evaluation and review of its contracts with customers, the timing and amount of revenue recognized based on ASU 2014-09 is consistent with the Company’s revenue recognition policy under previous guidance. The Company has therefore concluded that the adoption of ASU 2014-09 did not have a material impact on its financial position, results of operations, or cash flows. The Company’s revenues are generated through sales of its products to distributors or customers. Revenue is recognized at the point in which the performance obligation under the terms of a contract with the customer have been satisfied and control has transferred. The Company’s performance obligation is typically defined as the accepted purchase order or the contract with the customer which requires the Company to deliver the requested products at agreed upon prices at the time and location of the customer’s choice. The Company generally does not offer warranties or a right to return on the products it sells except in the instance of a product recall or other limited circumstances. Revenue is measured as the amount of consideration the Company expects to receive in exchange for fulfilling the performance obligation. Sales and other taxes the Company collects concurrent with the sale of products are excluded from revenue. The Company\\'s normal payment terms vary by the type and location of its customers and the products offered. The time between invoicing and when payment is due is not significant. None of the Company\\'s customer contracts as of December 31, 2022 contains a significant financing component. The Company routinely offers sales discounts and promotions through various programs to its customers and consumers. These programs include rebates, temporary on-shelf price reductions, off-invoice discounts, retailer advertisements, product coupons and other trade activities. Provision for discounts and incentives are recorded in the same period in which the related revenues are recognized. At the end of each accounting period, the Company recognizes a contra asset to accounts receivable for estimated sales discounts that have been incurred but not paid which totaled $ 4.6 million and $ 3.6 million as of December 31, 2022 and 2021, respectively. The offsetting charge is recorded as a reduction of revenues in the same period when the expense is incurred. BEYOND MEAT, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements (continued)  The Company recognizes the incremental costs of obtaining contracts as an expense when incurred if the amortization period of the assets that the Company otherwise would have recognized is one year or less. The incremental cost to obtain contracts was not material. Presentation of Net Revenues by Channel The following table presents the Company’s net revenues by channel:  Year Ended December 31, 2022 2021 2020 (in thousands) U.S.: Retail $ 234,744 \\xa0 $ 243,360 \\xa0 $ 264,111 \\xa0 Foodservice 69,289 \\xa0 76,475 \\xa0 60,763 \\xa0 U.S. net revenues 304,033 \\xa0 319,835 \\xa0 324,874 \\xa0 International: Retail 60,907 \\xa0 81,483 \\xa0 36,472 \\xa0 Foodservice 53,993 \\xa0 63,382 \\xa0 45,439 \\xa0 International net revenues 114,900 \\xa0 144,865 \\xa0 81,911 \\xa0 Net revenues $ 418,933 \\xa0 $ 464,700 \\xa0 $ 406,785 \\xa0 One distributor accounted for approximately 12 % of the Company’s gross revenues in 2022; two distributors accounted for approximately 12 % and 11 % of the Company’s gross revenues in 2021; and one customer accounted for approximately 13 % of the Company’s gross revenues in 2020. No other distributor or customer accounted for more than 10% of the Company’s gross revenues in 2022, 2021 or 2020. Earnings (Loss) Per Share Earnings (loss) per share (“EPS”) represents net income available to common stockholders divided by the weighted average number of common shares outstanding for the period. Diluted EPS represents net income available to common stockholders divided by the weighted-average number of common shares outstanding, inclusive of the dilutive impact of potential common shares outstanding during the period. Such potential common shares include options, unvested restricted stock, restricted stock units (“RSUs”), contracts classified as assets or liabilities that are required or assumed to be share-settled under the two-class method, warrants and convertible preferred stock. The Company calculates basic and diluted EPS available to common stockholders in conformity with the two-class method required for companies with participating securities. Pursuant to ASU 2020-06, the Company applies the more dilutive of the if-converted method and the two-class method to its Notes. The Company considers all series of convertible preferred stock issued and outstanding prior to the IPO to be participating securities. Under the two-class method, the net loss available to common stockholders was not allocated to the convertible preferred stock as the holders of convertible preferred stock issued and outstanding prior to the IPO did not have a contractual obligation to share in losses. Computation of EPS for the years ended December 31, 2021 and 2020 also excludes adjustments under the two-class method relating to a liability classified, share-settled obligation to an executive officer to deliver a variable number of shares based on a fixed monetary amount because the shares to be delivered are not participating securities as they do not have voting rights and are not entitled to participate in dividends until they are issued. Nonvested restricted stock awards (referred to as participating securities) are excluded from the dilutive impact of common equivalent shares outstanding in accordance with authoritative guidance under the two-class method. The nonvested restricted stockholders are entitled to participate in dividends declared on common BEYOND MEAT, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements (continued)  stock as if the shares were fully vested and hence nonvested restricted stock shares are deemed to be participating securities. Under the two-class method, net income, but not net loss, available to nonvested restricted stockholders is excluded from net income available to common stockholders for purposes of calculating basic and diluted EPS. Net loss available to common stockholders is not allocated to unvested restricted stock as the holders of unvested restricted stock do not have a contractual obligation to share in losses. In periods when the Company records net loss, all potential common shares are excluded in the computation of EPS because their inclusion would be anti-dilutive. See Note 12 . Prepaid Expenses Prepaid expenses primarily include prepaid insurance and other prepaid vendor costs, which are expensed in the period to which they relate. Investment in Joint Venture The Company uses the equity method of accounting to record transactions associated with its joint venture when the Company shares in joint control of the investee. Investment in joint venture is not consolidated but is recorded in “Investment in unconsolidated joint venture” in the Company’s consolidated balance sheet. The Company recognizes its portion of the investee’s results in “Equity in losses of unconsolidated joint venture” in its consolidated statement of operations. Selling, General and Administrative (“SG&A”) Expenses SG&A expenses are primarily comprised of selling, marketing expenses and administrative expenses, including personnel and related expenses, share-based compensation, outbound shipping and handling costs, non-manufacturing lease expense, depreciation and amortization expense on non-manufacturing and non-research and development assets, consulting fees and other non-production operating expenses. Marketing and selling expenses include advertising costs, share-based compensation awards to brand ambassadors, costs associated with consumer promotions, product donations, product samples and sales aids incurred to acquire new customers, retain existing customers and build brand awareness. Administrative expenses include expenses related to management, accounting, legal, IT and other office functions. Advertising costs are expensed as incurred. Advertising costs in the years ended December 31, 2022, 2021 and 2020 were $ 20.6 million, $ 12.1 million and $ 0.3 million, respectively. Non-advertising related components of the Company’s total marketing expenditures primarily include costs associated with consumer promotions, product sampling and sales aids, which are also included in SG&A. Shipping and Handling Costs The Company does not bill its distributors or customers shipping and handling fees. The Company’s products are predominantly shipped to its distributors or customers as “FOB Destination,” with control of the products transferred to the customer at the destination. In-bound shipping and handling costs incurred in manufacturing a product are included in inventory and reflected in cost of goods sold when the sale of that product is recognized. Outbound shipping and handling costs are considered as fulfillment costs and are recorded in SG&A expenses. Outbound shipping and handling costs included in SG&A expenses in 2022, 2021 and 2020 were $ 17.6 million, $ 19.1 million and $ 11.9 million, respectively. Research and Development Expenses Research and development costs, which includes enhancements to existing products and new product development, are expensed in the period incurred. Research and development expenses primarily consist of personnel and related expenses for the Company’s research and development staff, including salaries, benefits, bonuses, share-based compensation, scale-up expenses and depreciation and amortization expense on research and development assets, and facility lease costs. Research and development expenses in the years ended December 31, 2022, 2021 and 2020, were $ 62.3 million, $ 66.9 million and $ 31.5 million, respectively. BEYOND MEAT, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements (continued)  Share-Based Compensation The Company measures all share-based compensation cost at the grant date, based on the fair values of the awards that are ultimately expected to vest, and recognizes that cost as an expense in its consolidated statements of operations over the requisite service period. The Company estimates the fair value of option awards using the Black-Scholes option valuation model, which requires management to make certain assumptions for estimating the fair value of stock options at the date of grant including the fair value and projected volatility of the underlying common stock and the expected term of the award. The Black-Scholes option valuation model was developed for use in estimating the fair value of traded options that have no vesting restrictions and are fully transferable. Because the Company’s stock options have characteristics significantly different from those of traded options, and because changes in the subjective input assumptions can materially affect the fair value estimates, in management’s opinion, the existing models may not necessarily provide a reliable single measure of the fair value of the Company’s stock options. Although the fair value of stock options is determined using an option valuation model, that value may not be indicative of the fair value observed in a willing buyer/willing seller market transaction. In addition, the Company estimates the expected impact of forfeited awards and recognizes share-based compensation cost only for those awards ultimately expected to vest. If actual forfeiture rates differ materially from the Company’s estimates, share-based compensation expense could differ significantly from the amounts the Company has recorded in the current period. The Company periodically reviews actual forfeiture experience and will revise its estimates, as necessary. The Company will recognize as compensation cost the cumulative effect of the change in estimated forfeiture rates on current and prior periods in earnings of the period of revision. As a result, if the Company revises its assumptions and estimates, the Company’s share-based compensation expense could change materially in the future. See Note 9 . Employee Benefit Plan On January 1, 2017 the Company initiated a 401(k) retirement saving plan (“401-K Plan”) for the benefit of eligible employees. Under terms of this plan, eligible employees are able to make contributions of their wages on a tax-deferred basis. The Company has incurred $ 2.9 million, $ 1.5 million and $ 0.7 million in matching contribution to the 401-K Plan in 2022, 2021 and 2020, respectively. Restructuring Plan The Company accounts for exit or disposal activities in accordance with ASC 420, “Exit or Disposal Cost Obligations.” The Company defines a business restructuring as an exit or disposal activity that includes but is not limited to a program which is planned and controlled by management and materially changes either the scope of a business or the manner in which that business is conducted. Business restructuring charges may include (i) contract termination costs and (ii) other related costs associated with exit or disposal activities. Contract termination costs include costs to terminate a contract or costs that will continue to be incurred under the contract without benefit to the Company. A liability is recognized and measured at its fair value when the Company either terminates the contract or ceases using the rights conveyed by the contract. See Note 3 . Recently Adopted Accounting Pronouncements None. New Accounting Pronouncements None. Note 3. Restructuring In May 2017, management approved a plan to terminate the Company’s exclusive supply agreement (the “Agreement”) with one of its co-manufacturers, due to non-performance under the Agreement and on May 23, BEYOND MEAT, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements (continued)  2017, the Company notified the co-manufacturer of its decision to terminate the Agreement. In accordance with the Company’s policy of reviewing long-lived assets for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of such assets may not be recoverable, the Company determined that as of May 23, 2017, the date the Company notified the co-manufacturer of its decision to terminate the Agreement, the assets held in possession of the co-manufacturer were no longer recoverable. In 2022, 2021 and 2020, the Company recorded $ 17.3 million, $ 15.8 million and $ 6.4 million, respectively, in restructuring expenses related to this dispute, which consisted primarily of legal and other expenses. As of December 31, 2022 and 2021, the Company had $ 0.7 million and $ 2.7 million, respectively, in accrued unpaid liabilities associated with this contract termination. On October 18, 2022, the parties to this dispute entered into a confidential written settlement agreement and mutual release in connection with this matter. See Note 10 for further information. Note 4. Leases Leases are classified as either finance leases or operating leases based on criteria in ASC 842. The Company has operating leases for its corporate offices, the Campus Lease, its former Manhattan Beach Project Innovation Center, its manufacturing facilities, warehouses and vehicles, and to a lesser extent, certain equipment and finance leases. Such leases generally have original lease terms between 2 and 12 years, and often include one or more options to renew. Some leases also include early termination options, which can be exercised under specific conditions. The Company includes options to extend the lease term if the options are reasonably certain of being exercised. The Company does not have residual value guarantees or material restrictive covenants associated with its leases. On January 14, 2021, the Company entered into the Campus Lease, a 12-year lease with two 5 -year renewal options to house its corporate headquarters, lab and innovation space (the “Campus Headquarters”) in El Segundo, California. Although the Company is involved in the design of the tenant improvements of the Campus Headquarters, the Company does not have title or possession of the assets during construction. In addition, the Company does not have the ability to control the leased Campus Headquarters until each phase of the tenant improvements is complete. The Company contributed $ 55.1 million and $ 59.2 million in payments towards the construction of the Campus Headquarters in the year ended December 31, 2022 and 2021, respectively. These payments are initially recorded in “Prepaid lease costs, non-current” in the Company’s consolidated balance sheets and will ultimately be reclassified as a component of a right-of-use asset upon lease commencement for each phase of the lease. On September 15, 2022, the tenant improvements associated with Phase 1-A were completed, and the underlying asset was delivered to the Company. As such, upon commencement of Phase 1-A, the Company recognized a $ 64.1 million right-of-use asset, which included the reclassification of $ 27.7 million of the construction payments previously included in “Prepaid lease costs, non-current,” and a $ 36.6 million lease liability. Therefore, Phase 1-A of the Campus Lease is included in the tables below. The tables below also include the Company’s lease on the commercialization center in Commerce, California, which was terminated subsequent to the year ended December 31, 2022, on February 14, 2023.

On March 12, 2021, the initial purchasers of the Convertible Notes exercised their option to purchase an additional $ 150.0 million aggregate principal amount of the Company’s 0 % Convertible Senior Notes due 2027 (the “Additional Notes”, and together with the Convertible Notes, the “Notes”), and such Additional Notes were issued on March 16, 2021. The initial conversion price of the Notes is $ 206.00 per share of common stock, which represents a premium of approximately 47.5 % over the closing price of the Company’s common stock on March 2, 2021. The Notes will mature on March 15, 2027, unless earlier repurchased, redeemed or converted. The Notes were issued pursuant to, and are governed by, an indenture, dated as of March 5, 2021 (the “Indenture”), between the Company and U.S. Bank National Association, as trustee (the Trustee”). The Company used $ 84.0 million of the net proceeds from the sale of the Notes to fund the cost of entering into capped call transactions, described below. The proceeds from the issuance of the Notes were approximately $ 1.0 billion, net of capped call transaction costs of $ 84.0 million and debt issuance costs totaling $ 23.6 million. The Notes are senior, unsecured obligations and are (i) equal in right of payment with the Company’s senior, unsecured indebtedness; (ii) senior in right of payment to the Company’s indebtedness that is expressly subordinated to the Notes; (iii) effectively subordinated to the Company’s secured indebtedness, to the extent of the value of the collateral securing that indebtedness; and (iv) structurally subordinated to all existing and future indebtedness and other liabilities, including trade payables, and (to the extent the Company is not a holder thereof) preferred equity, if any, of the Company’s subsidiaries. The Notes do not bear regular interest, and the principal amount of the Notes do not accrete. However, special interest and additional interest may accrue on the Notes at a rate per annum not exceeding 0.50 % (subject to certain exceptions) upon the occurrence of certain events relating to the failure to file certain SEC reports or to remove certain restrictive legends from the Notes. The initial conversion rate is 4.8544 shares of common stock per $1,000 principal amount of the Notes, which represents an initial conversion price of $ 206.00 per share of common stock. The conversion rate and conversion price are subject to customary adjustments upon the occurrence of certain events as described in the Indenture. The holder may convert the Notes during the five consecutive business days immediately after any ten consecutive trading day period, if the trading price per $1,000 principal amount of Notes, as determined following a request by a holder, for each trading day of the measurement period was less than ninety eight percent ( 98 %) of the product of the last report sale price per share of common stock on such trading day and the conversion rate on such trading day. BEYOND MEAT, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements (continued)  The holder can convert its Notes during any calendar quarter, commencing after the calendar quarter ending on June 30, 2021, provided the last reported sale price of the common stock for at least 20 trading days is greater than or equal to 130 % of the conversion price, during the 30 consecutive trading days ending on the last trading day of a calendar quarter. Before December 15, 2026, noteholders have the right to convert their Notes upon the occurrence of certain events. From and after December 15, 2026, noteholders may convert their Notes at any time at their election until the close of business on the second scheduled trading day immediately before the maturity date. The Company has the right to elect to settle conversions either in cash, shares or in a combination of cash and shares of its common stock. However, upon conversion of any Notes, the conversion value, which will be determined over an “Observation Period” (as defined in the Indenture) consisting of 20 trading days, will be paid in cash up to at least the principal amount of the Notes being converted. The Notes will be redeemable, in whole or in part, at the Company’s option at any time, and from time to time, on or after March 20, 2024 and on or before the 20 th scheduled trading day immediately before the maturity date, at a cash redemption price equal to the principal amount of the Notes to be redeemed, plus accrued and unpaid special interest and additional interest, if any, to, but excluding, the redemption date, but only if the last reported sale price per share of the Company’s common stock exceeds 130 % of the conversion price on (i) each of at least 20 trading days, whether or not consecutive, during the 30 consecutive trading days ending on, and including, the trading day immediately before the date the Company sends the related redemption notice; and (ii) the trading day immediately before the date the Company sends such notice. In addition, calling any Note for redemption will constitute a “Make-Whole Fundamental Change” (as defined in the Indenture) with respect to that Note, in which case the conversion rate applicable to the conversion of that Note will be increased in certain circumstances if it is converted after it is called for redemption. The Company must repay the note principal in cash, but may elect to settle the conversion value either in cash, shares or in a combination of cash and shares of its common stock. If certain corporate events that constitute a “Fundamental Change” (as defined in the Indenture) occur, then, subject to limited exceptions, noteholders may require the Company to repurchase their Notes at a cash repurchase price equal to the principal amount of the Notes to be repurchased, plus accrued and unpaid special interest and additional interest, if any, to, but excluding, the fundamental change repurchase date. The definition of Fundamental Change includes certain business combination transactions involving the Company and certain de-listing events with respect to the Company’s common stock. The Notes have customary provisions relating to the occurrence of “Events of Default” (as defined in the Indenture), which include the following: (i) certain payment defaults on the Notes (which, in the case of a default in the payment of special interest and additional interest on the Notes, are subject to a 30 -day cure period); (ii) the Company’s failure to send certain notices under the Indenture within specified periods of time; (iii) the Company’s failure to comply with certain covenants in the Indenture relating to the Company’s ability to consolidate with or merge with or into, or sell, lease or otherwise transfer, in one transaction or a series of transactions, all or substantially all of the assets of the Company and its subsidiaries, taken as a whole, to another person; (iv) a default by the Company in its other obligations or agreements under the Indenture or the Notes if such default is not cured or waived within 60 days after notice is given in accordance with the Indenture; (v) certain defaults by the Company or any of its significant subsidiaries with respect to indebtedness for borrowed money of at least $ 100 million; and (vi) certain events of bankruptcy, insolvency and reorganization involving the Company or any of its significant subsidiaries. In the event of the Company’s liquidation, dissolution or winding up, holders of the Company’s common stock will be entitled to share ratably in the net assets legally available for distribution to stockholders after the payment of all of the Company’s debts and other liabilities and the satisfaction of any liquidation preference granted to the holders of any then-outstanding shares of preferred stock. BEYOND MEAT, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements (continued)  Holders of the Company’s common stock have no preemptive, conversion, subscription or other rights, and there are no redemption or sinking fund provisions applicable to the Company’s common stock. The rights, preferences and privileges of the holders of the Company’s common stock are subject to and may be adversely affected by the rights of the holders of shares of any series of preferred stock that the Company may designate in the future. If an Event of Default involving bankruptcy, insolvency or reorganization events with respect to the Company (and not solely with respect to a significant subsidiary of the Company) occurs, then the principal amount of, and any accrued and unpaid special interest and additional interest on, all of the Notes then outstanding will immediately become due and payable without any further action or notice by any person. If any other Event of Default occurs and is continuing, then, the Trustee, by notice to the Company, or noteholders of at least 25 % of the aggregate principal amount of Notes then outstanding, may declare the principal amount of, and any accrued and unpaid special interest and additional interest on, all of the Notes then outstanding to become due and payable immediately. However, notwithstanding the foregoing, the Company may elect, at its option, that the sole remedy for an Event of Default relating to certain failures by the Company to comply with certain reporting covenants in the Indenture consists exclusively of the right of the noteholders to receive special interest on the Notes for up to 365 days at a specified rate per annum not exceeding 0.50 % on the principal amount of the Notes. The total amount of debt issuance costs of $ 23.6 million was recorded as a reduction to “Convertible senior notes, net” in the consolidated balance sheet and are being amortized as interest expense over the term of the Notes using the effective interest method. During the years ended December 31, 2022 and December 31, 2021, the Company recognized $ 3.9 million and $ 3.3 million in interest expense related to the amortization of the debt issuance costs related to the Notes. The effective interest rate in both the years ended December 31, 2022 and December 31, 2021 was 0.3 %. The following is a summary of the Company’s Notes as of December 31, 2022:  (in thousands) Principal Amount Unamortized Issuance Costs Net Carrying Amount Fair Value Amount Leveling 0 % Convertible senior notes due on March 15, 2027 $ 1,150,000 \\xa0 $ 16,392 \\xa0 $ 1,133,608 \\xa0 $ 310,500 \\xa0 Level 2 The Notes are carried at face value less the unamortized debt issuance costs on the Company’s consolidated balance sheets. As of December 29, 2022, the estimated fair value of the Notes was approximately $ 310.5 million. The Notes are quoted on the Intercontinental Exchange and are classified as Level 2 financial instruments. The estimated fair value of the Notes was determined based on the actual bid price of the Notes on December 29, 2022, the last business day of the period. As of December 31, 2022, the remaining life of the Notes is approximately 4.2 years. Capped Call Transactions On March 2, 2021, in connection with the pricing of the offering of the Convertible Notes, the Company entered into capped call transactions (the “Base Capped Call Transactions”) with the option counterparties and used $ 73.0 million in net proceeds from the sale of the Convertible Notes to fund the cost of the Base Capped Call Transactions. On March 12, 2021, in connection with the Additional Notes, the Company entered into capped call transactions (the “Additional Capped Call Transactions”) with the option counterparties and used $ 11.0 million of the net proceeds from the sale of the Additional Notes to fund the cost of the Additional Capped Call Transactions. The Base Capped Call Transactions and the Additional Capped Call Transactions (collectively, the “Capped Call Transactions”) cover, subject to customary adjustments, the aggregate number of BEYOND MEAT, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements (continued)  shares of the Company’s common stock that will initially underlie the Notes, and are expected generally to reduce potential dilution to the Company’s common stock upon any conversion of Notes and/or offset any cash payments the Company may make in excess of the principal amount of the converted Notes, as the case may be, with such reduction and/or offset subject to a cap, based on the cap price of the Capped Call Transactions. The cap price of the Capped Call Transactions is $ 279.32 , which represents a premium of 100 % over the last reported sale price of the Company’s common stock on March 2, 2021. The aggregate $ 84.0 million paid for the Capped Call Transactions was recorded as a reduction to APIC. Revolving Credit Facility On March 2, 2021, the Company terminated its secured revolving credit agreement, dated as of April 21, 2020 (the “Credit Agreement”), among the Company, as borrower, the lenders party thereto and JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A., as the administrative agent, and in connection with such termination: (i) all borrowings outstanding under the Credit Agreement were repaid in full by the Company; and (ii) all liens and security interests under the Credit Agreement in favor of the lenders thereunder were released. Debt issuance costs associated with the credit facility were amortized as interest expense over the term of the loan. In the year ended December 31, 2021 debt issuance costs of $ 41,000 , related to the Company’s prior revolving credit facility, were amortized to interest expense. In the year ended December 31, 2020 debt issuance costs of $ 0.3 million related to the Company’s prior revolving credit facility and equipment loan were amortized to interest expense. In the years ended December 31, 2022, 2021 and 2020, the Company recorded $ 0 , $ 0.3 million, and $ 2.1 million, respectively, in interest expense related to its bank credit facilities. Note 8.

Share-Based Compensation In 2019, the Company’s 2011 Equity Incentive Plan (the “2011 Plan”) was amended, restated and re-named the 2018 Equity Incentive Plan (“2018 Plan”). The shares available for issuance under the 2011 Plan were added to the shares reserved for issuance under the 2018 Plan. The 2018 Plan provides for the grant of stock options (including incentive stock options and non-qualified stock options), stock appreciation rights, restricted stock, restricted stock units (“RSUs”), performance units, and performance shares to the Company’s employees, directors, and consultants. As of December 31, 2022, the maximum aggregate number of shares that may be issued under the 2018 Plan was 20,915,919 shares of the Company’s common stock. In addition, the number of shares reserved for issuance under the 2018 Plan will be increased automatically on the first day of each fiscal year beginning with the 2020 fiscal year, by a number equal to the least of: (i) 2,144,521 shares; (ii) 4.0 % of the shares of common stock outstanding on the last day BEYOND MEAT, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements (continued)  of the prior fiscal year; or (iii) such number of shares determined by the Company’s Board of Directors. As of January 1, 2023, the maximum aggregate number of shares that may be issued under the 2018 Plan increased to 23,060,440 shares. The 2018 Plan may be amended, suspended or terminated by the Company’s Board of Directors at any time, provided such action does not impair the existing rights of any participant, subject to stockholder approval of any amendment to the 2018 Plan as required by applicable law or listing requirements. Unless sooner terminated by the Company’s Board of Directors, the 2018 Plan will automatically terminate on November 14, 2028. The following table summarizes the shares available for grant under the 2018 Plan:  Shares Available for Grant Balance - December 31, 2021 6,515,807 \\xa0 Authorized 2,144,521 \\xa0 Granted ( 1,943,701 ) Shares withheld to cover taxes 40,795 \\xa0 Forfeited 1,091,410 \\xa0 Balance - December 31, 2022 7,848,832 \\xa0 As of December 31, 2022 and 2021, there were 3,999,933 and 3,956,364 shares, respectively, issuable under stock options outstanding, 993,313 and 608,175 shares, respectively, issuable under unvested RSUs outstanding, and 8,145,769 and 7,730,884 shares, respectively, issued for stock option exercises and RSU settlement. Stock Options Following are the assumptions used in the Black-Scholes valuation model for options granted during the periods shown below:  Year Ended December 31, 2022 2021 2020 Risk-free interest rate 2.3 % 1.4 % 1.3 % Average expected term (years) 7.0 7.0 7.0 Expected volatility 55.0 % 55.7 % 55.0 % Dividend yield — — — • Risk-Free Interest Rate: The yield on actively traded non-inflation indexed US Treasury notes with the same maturity as the expected term of the underlying options was used as the average risk-free interest rate. • Expected Term: As the Company does not have sufficient historical experience for determining the expected term of the stock option awards granted, the Company’s expected term is based on the simplified method, generally calculated as the mid-point between the vesting date and the end of the contractual term. • Expected Volatility: As the Company has only been a public entity since May 2, 2019, there is not a substantive share price history to calculate volatility and, as such, the Company has elected to use an approximation based on the volatility of other comparable public companies, which compete directly with the Company, over the expected term of the options. BEYOND MEAT, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements (continued)  • Dividend Yield: The Company has not issued regular dividends on common shares in the past nor does the Company expect to issue dividends in the future. Forfeiture Rate: The Company estimates the forfeiture rate at the time of grant based on past awards canceled, the number of awards granted, and vesting terms and adjusted, if necessary, in subsequent periods if actual forfeitures differ from those estimates. The cumulative effect on current and prior periods of a change in the estimated number of awards likely to vest is recognized in compensation cost in the period of the change. The 2018 Plan generally provides that the Board of Directors may set the vesting schedule applicable to grants approved under the 2018 Plan. The Company has not granted equity awards with performance-based vesting conditions. Option grants to new and continuing employees in 2022, and to new employees in 2021 and 2020, generally vest 25 % of the total award on the first anniversary of the vesting commencement date, and thereafter ratably vesting monthly over the remaining three-year period, subject to continued employment through the vesting date. Option grants to continuing employees in 2021 and 2020 generally vest monthly over a 48 -month period, subject to continued employment through the vesting date. Option grants to certain continuing employees in 2021 vest every six months over two years , subject to continued employment through the vesting date. An option grant to one executive officer in 2021 vested over three months from the vesting commencement date.

The 2018 ESPP is intended to qualify as an “employee stock purchase plan” within the meaning of Section 423 of the Internal Revenue Code (the “Code”) for U.S. employees. In addition, the 2018 ESPP authorizes grants of purchase rights that do not comply with Section 423 of the Code under a separate non-423 component for non-U.S. employees and certain non-U.S. service providers. As of December 31, 2022, the Company has reserved 2,412,585 shares of common stock for issuance under the 2018 ESPP. In addition, the number of shares reserved for issuance under the 2018 ESPP will be increased automatically on the first day of each fiscal year for a period of up to ten years , starting with the 2020 fiscal year, by a number equal to the least of: (i) 536,130 shares; (ii) 1.0 % of the shares of common stock outstanding on the last day of the prior fiscal year; or (iii) such lesser number of shares determined by the Company’s Board of Directors. As of January 1, 2023, the maximum aggregate number of shares that may be issued under the 2018 ESPP increased to 2,948,715 shares. The 2018 ESPP is expected to be implemented through a series of offerings under which participants are granted purchase rights to purchase shares of the Company’s common stock on specified dates during such offerings. The administrator has not yet approved an offering under the 2018 ESPP. Note 10. Commitments and Contingencies Leases On January 14, 2021, the Company entered into the Campus Lease with HC Hornet Way, LLC, a Delaware limited liability company (the “Landlord”), to house the Company’s Campus Headquarters.

During 2022, the tenant improvements associated with Phase 1-A were completed and the underlying asset was delivered to the Company. Therefore, the Company has recognized a right-of-use asset and lease liability for Phase 1-A in its consolidated balance sheet as of December 31, 2022. See Note 4 . Aggregate payments towards base rent over the initial lease term associated with the remaining phases not yet delivered to the Company will be approximately $ 118.4 million. Concurrent with the Company’s execution of the Campus Lease, as a security deposit, the Company delivered to the Landlord a letter of credit in the amount of $ 12.5 million which amount will decrease to: (i) $ 6.3 million on the fifth (5th) anniversary of the Rent Commencement Date (as defined in the Campus Lease); (ii) $ 3.1 million on the eighth (8th) anniversary of the Rent Commencement Date; and (iii) $ 0 in the event the Company receives certain credit ratings; provided the Company is not then in default of its obligations under the Campus Lease. The letter of credit is secured by a $ 12.6 million deposit reflected in the Company’s consolidated balance sheet as “Restricted cash” as of December 31, 2022. China Investment and Lease Agreement On September 22, 2020, the Company and its subsidiary, BYND JX, entered into an investment agreement with the Administrative Committee (the “JX Committee”) of the Jiaxing Economic & Technological Development Zone (the “JXEDZ”) pursuant to which, among other things, BYND JX has agreed to make certain investments in the JXEDZ in two phases of development, and the Company has agreed to guarantee certain repayment obligations of BYND JX under such agreement. In the year ended December 31, 2022 and 2021, the Company received $ 0 and $ 1.1 million, respectively, in subsidies from the JXEDZ Finance Bureau which is recorded in “Other, net” in the Company’s consolidated statement of operations. During Phase 1, the Company agreed to invest $ 10.0 million as the registered capital of BYND JX in the JXEDZ through intercompany investment in BYND JX and BYND JX agreed to lease a facility in the JXEDZ for a minimum of two years . In connection with such agreement, BYND JX entered into a factory leasing contract with an affiliate of the JX Committee, pursuant to which BYND JX agreed to lease and renovate a facility in the JXEDZ and lease it for a minimum of two years . In the year ended December 31, 2022, the lease was amended to extend the term for an additional five years without rent escalation. In the fourth quarter of 2021, BYND JX leased an approximately 12,000 square foot facility in Shanghai, China, for a period of eight years , which is used as a local research and development facility to support the local manufacturing operations. As of December 31, 2022, the Company had invested $ 22.0 million as the registered capital of BYND JX and advanced $ 20.0 million to BYND JX. In the event that the Company and BYND JX determine, in their sole discretion, to proceed with the Phase 2 development in the JXEDZ, BYND JX has agreed in the first stage of Phase 2 to increase its registered capital to $ 40.0 million and to acquire the land use right to a state-owned land plot in the JXEDZ to conduct development and construction of a new production facility. Following the first stage of Phase 2, the Company and BYND JX may determine, in their sole discretion, to permit BYND JX to obtain a second state-owned land plot in the JXEDZ in order to construct an additional facility thereon. The Planet Partnership On January 25, 2021, the Company entered into TPP, a joint venture with PepsiCo, Inc., to develop, produce and market innovative snack and beverage products made from plant-based protein. For the years ended December 31, 2022 and December 31, 2021, the Company recognized its share of the net losses in TPP in the amount of $ 18.9 million and $ 3.0 million, respectively. For the year ended December 31, 2021, the Company contributed its share of the investment in TPP, $ 11.0 million, which was increased to $ 24.3 million in the year ended December 31, 2022. See Note 2 and Note 13 . Subsequent to the year ended December 31, 2022, the Company contributed an additional $ 3.3 million as its share of the additional investment in TPP. BEYOND MEAT, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements (continued)  In the fourth quarter of 2022, the Company began taking steps to restructure certain contracts and operating activities related to Beyond Meat Jerky. Such activities are expected to continue through most of 2023. Purchase Commitments As of December 31, 2022, the Company had committed to purchase pea protein inventory totaling $ 40.2 million in 2023. On April 6, 2022, the Company entered into a co-manufacturing agreement (“Agreement”) with a co-manufacturer to manufacture various products for the Company. The Agreement includes a minimum order quantity commitment per month and an aggregate quantity over a 5-year term. For a portion of the contract term, if the minimum order for a month is not fulfilled, the Company may be assessed a fee per pound, which fee may be waived by the co-manufacturer upon reaching certain aggregate quantity limits. The following table sets forth the schedule of the fees for the committed quantity under the Agreement.

On October 18, 2022, the parties entered into a confidential written settlement agreement and mutual release, pursuant to which the parties agreed to dismiss all claims and cross-claims asserted in the State Court Case and Federal Court Case with prejudice. The terms of the settlement did not have a material impact on Beyond Meat’s financial position or results of operations. No party admitted liability or wrongdoing in connection with the settlement. Consumer Class Actions Regarding Protein Claims From May 31, 2022 through January 13, 2023, multiple putative class action lawsuits were filed against the Company in various federal and state courts alleging that the labeling and marketing of certain of the Company’s products is false and/or misleading under federal and/or various states’ laws. Specifically, each of these lawsuits allege one or more of the following theories of liability: (i) that the labels and related marketing of the challenged products misstate the quantitative amount of protein that is provided by each serving of the product; (ii) that the labels and related marketing of the challenged products misstate the percent daily value of protein that is provided by each serving of the product; and (iii) that the Company has represented that the challenged products are “all-natural,” “organic,” or contain no “synthetic” ingredients when they in fact contain methylcellulose, an allegedly synthetic ingredient. The named plaintiffs of each complaint seek to represent classes of nationwide and/or state-specific consumers, and seek on behalf of the putative classes damages, BEYOND MEAT, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements (continued)  restitution, and injunctive relief, among other relief. Additional complaints asserting these theories of liability are possible. Some lawsuits previously filed were voluntarily withdrawn or dismissed without prejudice; though they may be refiled. On November 14, 2022, Beyond Meat filed a motion with the Judicial Panel on Multidistrict Litigation to transfer and consolidate all pending class actions. No party opposed the motion, and the Panel held oral argument on the motion on January 26, 2023. The Panel granted the motion on February 1, 2023, consolidating the pending class action lawsuits and transferring them to Judge Sara Ellis in the Northern District of Illinois for pre-trial proceedings. The initial status conference in the multidistrict litigation is set for March 3, 2023. The Company intends to vigorously defend against all claims asserted in the complaints. Based on the Company’s current knowledge, the Company has determined that the amount of any material loss or range of any losses that is reasonably possible to result from these lawsuits is not estimable. The active lawsuits are: • Roberts v. Beyond Meat, Inc., No. 1:22-cv-02861 (N.D. Ill.) (filed May 31, 2022) • Cascio v. Beyond Meat, Inc., No. 1:22-cv-04018 (E.D.N.Y.) (filed July 8, 2022) • Miller v. Beyond Meat, Inc., No. 1:22-cv-06336 (S.D.N.Y.) (filed July 26, 2022) • Garcia v. Beyond Meat, Inc., No. 4:22-cv-00297 (S.D. IA.) (filed September 9, 2022) • Borovoy v. Beyond Meat, Inc., No. 1:22-cv-06302 (N.D. Ill.) (filed September 30, 2022 in DuPage Co., Ill.; removed on Nov. 10, 2022) • Zakinov v Beyond Meat, Inc., No. 4:23-cv-00144 (SD TX) (filed January 13, 2023) Securities Related Litigation As previously reported by the Company in the 2021 10-K and on Form 10-Q for the fiscal quarter ended July 2, 2022 filed with the SEC on August 11, 2022, the parties have reached a settlement of the Weiner, Brink/Klein and Chew derivative actions. On April 8, 2022, the Company published notice of the preliminary approval and the proposed settlement in accordance with the Stipulation of Settlement. On April 18, 2022, the Company paid to escrow the $ 515,000 for Plaintiffs’ attorneys’ fees and costs and on April 19, 2022, the Company filed proof of notice with the Court. Plaintiffs filed their motion for final approval on June 13, 2022. On July 1, 2022, Plaintiffs filed a notice of non-objection, stating that they received no objections to the proposed settlement. The Final Approval Hearing was scheduled for July 11, 2022, but on July 7, 2022, the Court entered a Scheduling Notice and Order finding that Plaintiffs’ motion for final approval is appropriate for submission on the papers without oral argument. On September 27, 2022, the Court entered a Final Order and Judgment approving the settlement. The appeal period expired on October 27, 2022, which means that the settlement of these actions is now final. On October 31, 2022, plaintiff’s counsel in the Chew action, in accordance with the Stipulation of Settlement, filed a Joint Stipulation and [Proposed] Order to Dismiss Action with Prejudice, which was signed and entered by the Court on November 1, 2022. Interbev In October 2020, Interbev, a French trade association for the cattle industry sent a cease-and-desist letter to one of the Company’s contract manufacturers alleging that the use of “meat” and meat-related terms is misleading the French consumer. Despite the Company’s best efforts to reach a settlement, including a formal settlement proposal from the Company in March 2021, the association no longer responded. Instead, on March 13, 2022, the Company was served a summons by Interbev to appear before the Commercial Court of Paris. The summons alleges that the Company misleads the French consumer with references to e.g. “plant based BEYOND MEAT, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements (continued)  meat,” “plant based burger” and related descriptive names, and alleges that the Company is denigrating meat and meat products. The relief sought by Interbev includes (i) changing the presentation of Beyond Meat products to avoid any potential confusion with meat products, (ii) publication of the judgment of the court in the media, and (iii) damages of EUR 200,000 . On October 12, 2022, the Company submitted its brief in defense. On February 1, 2023, the French trade association submitted updated pleadings to the Commercial Court. The association maintains its position that the Company is misleading the consumer, and additionally alleges that it is engaging in unlawful comparative advertising of its products with respect to meat and meat products. The relief sought is unchanged. The Company strongly disputes these claims and will defend its position with the utmost vigor. The litigation is expected to take at least 18 months in the first instance, and if the Court rules against the Company, it could disrupt the Company’s ability to market in France. Decree prohibiting meat names On June 29, 2022, France adopted a Decree implementing a prohibition of June 2020 on the use of denominations used for foodstuffs of animal origin to describe, market or promote foodstuffs containing plant proteins (“Decree”). The Decree prohibits the use of meat names (such as “sausage” or “meatballs”) for plant-based products, from its date of entry into force on October 1, 2022. On July 27, 2022, the French High Administrative Court issued a temporary and partial suspension of the execution of the Decree, in response to a motion filed by a French trade association. While the Court has not yet handed down a decision on the merits, the suspension indicates that it has serious doubts as to the substantive lawfulness of the Decree. The Company does not believe that the Decree complies with the laws of the European Union (EU), and in particular the principle of free movement of goods, nor with French rules requiring laws to be clear and accessible. On October 21, 2022, the Company filed a request for annulment of the Decree before the French High Administrative Court. On November 16, 2022, the Company filed a voluntary intervention in the French trade association’s own application for annulment, to ensure that both the Company’s voice and strong EU law arguments are heard. On January 23, 2023, the French Ministry for the Economy responded to the Company’s request for annulment and intervention. The Ministry’s response makes clear that it will enforce the Decree as a blanket ban on the use of all meaty names for plant-based products in France. The Company maintains its position that the Decree is illegal under French and EU law, and will continue to fight the Decree with utmost vigor. A decision from the Court is expected sometime during 2023, and should the Court hold that the Decree is lawful, it could impact the Company’s ability to market in France, as it will need to take steps to amend its labels in line with the Decree. The Company is involved in various other legal proceedings, claims, and litigation arising in the ordinary course of business. Based on the facts currently available, the Company does not believe that the disposition of such matters that are pending or asserted will have a material effect on its financial statements.

Income Taxes A reconciliation of loss before income taxes for domestic and foreign locations for the years ended December 31, 2022, 2021 and 2020 is as follows:  (in thousands) Year Ended December 31, 2022 2021 2020 United States $ ( 290,765 ) $ ( 155,810 ) $ ( 51,378 ) Foreign ( 56,392 ) ( 23,258 ) ( 1,302 ) Loss before income taxes $ ( 347,157 ) $ ( 179,068 ) $ ( 52,680 ) BEYOND MEAT, INC.

The provision for income taxes in 2022, 2021 and 2020 is primarily for taxes payable to the states. A reconciliation of income tax expense from continuing operations to the amount computed by applying the statutory federal income tax rate to the net loss from continuing operations is summarized as follows:  Year Ended December 31, (in thousands) 2022 2021 2020 U.S. income tax at federal statutory rate $ ( 72,902 ) $ ( 38,229 ) $ ( 11,063 ) State income tax, net of federal benefits ( 8,841 ) ( 4,991 ) ( 1,962 ) Foreign rate differential ( 2,536 ) ( 985 ) ( 54 ) Share-based compensation 1,479 \\xa0 ( 4,932 ) ( 21,007 ) Research and development credits ( 5 ) ( 20 ) ( 10 ) Change in tax rates 204 \\xa0 ( 719 ) 2,989 \\xa0 Other ( 2,807 ) 771 \\xa0 529 \\xa0 Change in valuation allowance 85,440 \\xa0 49,165 \\xa0 30,650 \\xa0 Provision for income tax $ 32 \\xa0 $ 60 \\xa0 $ 72 \\xa0 BEYOND MEAT, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements (continued)  Significant components of the Company\\'s deferred tax assets and liabilities as of December 31, 2022, and 2021 are shown below.  December 31, (in thousands) 2022 2021 Deferred Tax Assets: Net operating loss (NOL) $ 198,358 \\xa0 $ 128,006 \\xa0 Operating lease liability 20,659 \\xa0 — \\xa0 Intangibles 7,189 \\xa0 1,308 \\xa0 Share-based compensation 8,746 \\xa0 4,584 \\xa0 Interest — \\xa0 388 \\xa0 Inventory reserve 3,757 \\xa0 2,139 \\xa0 Other 11,087 \\xa0 1,820 \\xa0 Total gross deferred tax assets 249,796 \\xa0 138,245 \\xa0 Deferred Tax liabilities: Operating lease right-of-use assets 20,497 \\xa0 — \\xa0 Property, plant and equipment 4,805 \\xa0 3,056 \\xa0 Total gross deferred tax liabilities 25,302 \\xa0 3,056 \\xa0 Valuation allowance 224,494 \\xa0 135,189 \\xa0 Net deferred tax assets (liabilities) $ — \\xa0 $ — \\xa0 As of December 31, 2022 and 2021, management assessed the realizability of deferred tax assets and evaluated the need for an amount of a valuation allowance for deferred tax assets on a jurisdictional basis. This evaluation utilizes the framework contained in ASC 740, “Income Taxes,” pursuant to which management analyzed all positive and negative evidence available at the balance sheet date to determine whether all or some portion of the deferred tax assets will not be realized. Under this guidance, a valuation allowance must be established for deferred tax assets when it is more likely than not (a probability level of more than 50%) that they will not be realized. In concluding on the evaluation, management placed significant emphasis on guidance in ASC 740, which states that “a cumulative loss in recent years is a significant piece of negative evidence that is difficult to overcome.” Based upon available evidence, it was concluded on a more-likely-than-not basis that certain deferred tax assets were not realizable as of December 31, 2022. Accordingly, a valuation allowance of $ 224.5 million has been recorded to offset these deferred tax assets. The change in valuation allowance for the year ended December 31, 2022 from 2021 was an increase of $ 89.3 million. As of December 31, 2022, the Company has accumulated federal, state and foreign net operating loss carryforwards of approximately $ 744.5 million, $ 314.2 million and $ 84.1 million, respectively, of which approximately $ 652.7 million of the federal net operating losses and $ 84.9 million of the state net operating losses do not expire and the remaining federal, state and foreign tax loss carryforwards begin to expire in 2031, 2031 and 2025 respectively, unless previously utilized. As of December 31, 2021, the Company had accumulated federal, state and foreign net operating loss carryforwards of approximately $ 514.1 million, $ 201.7 million and $ 24.6 million, respectively. Pursuant to Internal Revenue Code (IRC) Sections 382 and 383, annual use of the Company\\'s net operating loss (NOLs) and research and development credit carryforwards may be limited in the event a cumulative change in ownership of more than 50% occurs within a three-year period. The Company has BEYOND MEAT, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements (continued)  completed a section 382 analysis through October 1, 2022 and concluded ownership changes occurred in 2011, 2013 and 2015. However, these ownership changes are not expected to result in a material limitation on future use of the Company’s NOLs and credit carryforwards generated prior to these ownership changes pursuant. Changes may have occurred in the fourth quarter of 2022 and may occur in the future that could limit the Company\\'s ability to utilize tax attributes. Any adjustment to the Company\\'s tax attributes as a result of such ownership changes will result in a corresponding decrease to the valuation allowance recorded against the Company\\'s deferred tax assets. The following table summarizes the activity related to the Company’s gross unrecognized tax benefits at the beginning and end of the years ended December 31, 2022 and 2021:  Year Ended December 31, (in thousands) 2022 2021 Gross unrecognized tax benefits at the beginning of the year $ 8,861 \\xa0 $ 5,399 \\xa0 Increases related to current year positions 1,465 \\xa0 3,462 \\xa0 Increases/Decreases related to prior year positions — \\xa0 — \\xa0 Expiration of unrecognized tax benefits — \\xa0 — \\xa0 Gross unrecognized tax benefits at the end of the year $ 10,326 \\xa0 $ 8,861 \\xa0 As of December 31, 2022 and 2021, the Company had $ 9.4 million and $ 8.0 million, respectively, of unrecognized tax benefits from research and development tax credits, none of which, if recognized, would affect the Company’s effective tax rate. The Company recognizes interest and penalties accrued related to unrecognized tax benefits in income tax expense. During the years ended December 31, 2022, 2021, and 2020, interest and penalties recognized were insignificant. The Company does not expect any significant increases or decreases to its unrecognized tax benefits within the next 12 months. The Company files U.S. federal, state and foreign income tax returns in jurisdictions with varying statute of limitations. The Company’s tax years from 2011 (inception) are subject to examination by the US federal, state and foreign tax authorities due to the carry forward of unutilized tax attributes. With respect to the income of its foreign subsidiaries, the Company asserts the position that the undistributed earnings of its foreign subsidiaries are permanently invested in that jurisdiction. As a result, no additional income taxes have been provided on the possible repatriation of these earnings to the parent company. The Company does not have any unremitted earnings as of December 31, 2022. The Tax Cuts and Jobs Act subjects a U.S. shareholder to tax on Global Intangible Low-taxes Income (“GILTI”) earned by certain foreign subsidiaries. Pursuant to the FASB Staff Q&A, Topic 740 No.5. Accounting for Global Intangible Low-taxed Income, the Company is allowed to make an accounting policy election to either recognize deferred taxes for temporary basis differences expected to reverse as GIL TI in future years or to provide for the tax expense related to GILTI in the year the tax is incurred as period expense only. The Company has elected to account for GILTI in the year the tax is incurred. Note 12. Net Loss Per Share Available to Common Stockholders (“EPS”) The Company calculates basic and diluted net loss per share available to common stockholders in conformity with the two-class method required for companies with participating securities. Pursuant to ASU 2020-06, the Company applies the more dilutive of the if-converted method and the two-class method to its Notes. See Note 2 . BEYOND MEAT, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements (continued)  Computation of EPS for the year ended December 31, 2022 and 2021 excludes the dilutive effect of 3,999,933 and 3,956,364 shares issuable under stock options, respectively, and 993,313 and 608,175 RSUs, respectively, because the Company incurred a net loss and their inclusion would have been antidilutive. Computation of EPS for the year ended December 31, 2020 also excludes adjustments under the two-class method relating to a liability classified, share-settled obligation to an executive officer to deliver a variable number of shares based on a fixed monetary amount because the shares to be delivered are not participating securities as they do not have voting rights and are not entitled to participate in dividends until they are issued. The share-settled obligation that was scheduled to vest in the third quarter of 2021 was canceled because the executive officer separated from the Company before the vest date and the award was not earned (see Note 9 ). Computation of net loss per share available to common stockholders for the years ended December 31, 2022 and 2021 also exclude the dilutive effect of the Notes because the Company recorded a net loss in each of the years ended December 31, 2022 and 2021, and their inclusion would be anti-dilutive. Computation of EPS for the year ended December 31, 2020 excludes the dilutive effect of 4,218,278 shares issuable under stock options because the Company incurred a net loss and their inclusion would have been antidilutive.

General Risk Factors , such as, high volatility in our share price; reduction in our share price due to a substantial number of sales; decline in our share price and trading volume due to adverse or misleading opinions by securities or industry analysts regarding our business; no history of paying dividends or \\n\\nplans to pay dividends to our stockholders in the foreseeable future; provisions included in our charter documents to delay or prevent a change in control of our company; limitation of stockholders&#8217; ability to obtain a favorable judicial forum for disputes due to the exclusive forum provision in our restated certificate of incorporation; and limitation of our ability to utilize our federal net operating loss and tax credit carryforwards. \\n\\nRisk Factors \\n\\nRisks Related to Our Business \\n\\nDisruptions in the worldwide economy, including an economic recession, downturn, periods of inflation or economic uncertainty, have and may continue to adversely affect our business, results of operations and financial condition. \\n\\nThe global economy can be negatively impacted by a variety of factors such as the spread or fear of spread of contagious diseases (such as the COVID-19 pandemic, other pandemics, epidemics or other public health crises) in locations where our products are sold, man-made or natural disasters, severe weather, actual or threatened hostilities or war, terrorist activity, political unrest, civil strife and other geopolitical uncertainty. Such adverse and uncertain economic conditions may impact distributor, retailer, foodservice and consumer demand for our products. For example, in connection with the war in Ukraine, governments in the U.S., U.K. and the EU have each imposed export controls on certain products and financial and economic sanctions on certain industry sectors and parties in Russia. The uncertainty resulting from the military conflict in Europe has given rise and may continue to give rise to increases in costs of goods and services, scarcity of certain ingredients, increased trade barriers or restrictions on global trade and may increase volatility in financial and capital markets, which may make it more difficult for us to raise additional capital. Further escalation of geopolitical tensions could have a broader impact that expands into other markets where we do business, which could adversely affect our business and/or our supply chain, our international subsidiaries, business partners or customers in the broader region, including potential destabilizing effects that such conflicts may pose for the European continent or the global oil and natural gas markets. In addition, our ability to manage normal commercial relationships with our suppliers, co-manufacturers, distributors, retailers, foodservice customers, consumers and creditors may suffer. \\n\\nStarting in 2020, the COVID-19 pandemic had a significant impact on the worldwide economy and, in turn, our business, financial condition and results of operations. Although we expect the impacts of the pandemic, and the resulting effects on the economy, on us to continue to decline, we are likely to see certain prolonged effects. For example, certain of our QSR customers reduced their menu offerings in response to COVID-19, which negatively impacted plant-based food items. If those customers are slow to re-expand their menus, or choose not to put plant-based products back on their menus, our business could be adversely affected. \\n\\nAs global economic conditions continue to be volatile or uncertain and recessionary or inflationary pressures exist, trends in consumer discretionary spending also remain unpredictable and subject to changes. We have seen consumers shift purchases to lower-priced or other perceived value offerings during economic downturns as a result of various factors, including job losses, inflation, higher taxes, reduced access to credit, change in federal economic policy and recent international trade disputes. In particular, consumers have reduced the amount of plant-based food products that they purchase where there are conventional animal-based protein offerings, which generally have lower retail prices. In addition, consumers may choose to purchase private label products rather than branded products because they are generally less expensive. A decrease in consumer discretionary spending may also result in consumers reducing the frequency and amount spent on food prepared away from home. Distributors, retailers and foodservice customers have become more conservative in response to these conditions and have sought to reduce their inventories. Our results of operations depend upon, among other things, our ability to maintain and increase sales volume with our existing distributors, retailer and foodservice customers, our ability to attract new consumers, the financial condition of our consumers and our ability to provide products that appeal to consumers at the right price. Decreases in demand for our products without a corresponding decrease in costs has put downward pressure on margins and has and may continue to negatively impact our financial results. Prolonged unfavorable economic \\n\\nconditions or uncertainty would be expected to have an adverse effect on our sales and profitability and may result in consumers making long-lasting changes to their discretionary spending behavior on a more permanent basis. \\n\\nInflationary price pressures of raw materials, labor, transportation, fuel or other inputs used by us and our suppliers, including the effects of rising interest rates, has negatively impacted, and could continue to negatively impact, our business and results of operations. \\n\\nOur operating environment has been impacted by inflation and rising interest rates. Increases in the price of raw materials, labor, wages, energy or other inputs that we or our suppliers use in manufacturing and supplying products, along with logistics, transportation, shipping, fuel and other related costs, has led to higher production and shipping costs for our products. Any increase in the cost of inputs to our production has led to higher costs for our products in our foodservice and retail channels and has negatively impacted and may continue to negatively impact our operating results and future profitability. General inflation, including rising energy prices, interest rates and wages, currency volatility and monetary, fiscal and policy interventions by national or regional governments in reaction to such events could continue to have negative impacts on our business by increasing our operating costs and our borrowing costs as well as decreasing the capital available for our customers to purchase our products. The United States Federal Reserve has raised its benchmark interest rate multiple times. Several other central banks, including the European Central Bank, have signaled increases in benchmark interest rates. Increased borrowing costs faced by our customers could result in decreased demand for our products. The impact of inflation could also reduce consumer confidence and decrease consumer discretionary spending, including spending to purchase our products, and negatively affect trends in consumer purchasing patterns due to changes in consumers&#8217; disposable income, credit availability and debt levels. The impact of high inflation and the plant-based meat sector&#8217;s premium pricing relative to animal protein have caused and could continue to cause consumers to trade down into cheaper forms of protein, including animal meat. \\n\\nWe have a history of losses, and we may be unable to achieve or sustain profitability. \\n\\nWe have experienced net losses in almost every period since our inception. In 2022, 2021 and 2020, we incurred net losses of $366.1 million, $182.1 million and $52.8 million, respectively. Although we anticipate decreasing our operating expenses in 2023, over time our operating expenses and capital expenditures may increase as we hire additional employees; support our strategic and other QSR customer relationships; innovate and commercialize products; build our brand, expand our marketing channels and drive consumer adoption of our products; continue to invest to expand our production capacity through our own internal production facilities, domestically and abroad; build out our Campus Headquarters; increase our customer base, supplier network and co-manufacturing partners; scale production across distribution channels; pursue geographic expansion; and enhance our technology and production capabilities. These efforts may prove more expensive than we anticipate, and we may not succeed in increasing our revenues and margins sufficiently to offset the anticipated higher expenses. We incur significant expenses in developing our innovative products, building out our facilities, securing an adequate supply of raw materials, obtaining and storing ingredients and other products and marketing the products we offer. In addition, many of our expenses, including some of the costs associated with our existing and any future manufacturing facilities, are fixed. Accordingly, we may not be able to successfully implement our new sustainable growth strategy or achieve or sustain profitability, and we may incur significant losses for the foreseeable future. \\n\\nOur strategic initiatives to reduce our cost structure towards cash flow positive operations could have long-term adverse effects on our business, and we may not realize the operational or financial benefits from such actions. \\n\\nOur cost-reduction initiatives, expected charges and savings related to our recent workforce reductions and executive leadership changes, and the timing and success of achieving our cash flow positive targets are subject to many risks and uncertainties. The charges associated with the reduction-in-force and executive leadership changes may be greater than anticipated, completion of the reduction-in-force may take longer than anticipated, we may be unable to realize the contemplated benefits in connection with the workforce reduction, executive leadership changes and other potential cost-reduction initiatives, and the workforce reduction, \\n\\nexecutive leadership changes and cost-reduction initiatives may have an adverse impact on our performance. Additionally, our ability to meet our cash flow positive targets is subject to a number of assumptions and uncertainties, including, without limitation, our ability to reduce costs and achieve positive gross margins; our ability to meet certain revenue and operating expense targets, which may be subject to factors beyond our control; and our ability to monetize inventory and manage working capital. The other risks described in this report may also hinder our ability to implement our strategic initiatives. \\n\\nAs we continue to identify areas of cost savings and operating efficiencies, we may consider implementing further measures to help streamline operations and improve our cost efficiencies, including downsizing or exiting certain operations. However, our strategic growth initiatives may not be adequate to support the long-term operations of our business, particularly under adverse circumstances, Furthermore, we may not be successful in implementing these initiatives or realizing our anticipated savings and efficiencies, including as a result of factors beyond our control. In the event we have excess capacity or vacancy in any of our facilities or office spaces, we may sublease portions of the excess space to third parties and may be unable to sublease our excess space on favorable terms, or at all, or if we are able to sublease space but our subtenants fail to make lease payments to us or otherwise default on their obligations to us, we could incur substantial payment obligations to our landlords. If we are unable to realize the anticipated savings and efficiencies of our cost reduction initiatives and related strategic initiatives, our operating and financial results would be adversely affected and could differ materially from our expectations. \\n\\nOur inability to streamline operations and improve cost efficiencies could result in the contraction of our business and the implementation of significant cost cutting measures. \\n\\nWe have undertaken efforts to streamline operations and improve cost efficiencies, including related to our supply chain, marketing and commercialization efforts. For example, on August 3, 2022 and October 14, 2022, we announced reductions-in-force affecting approximately 4% and 19%, respectively, of our global workforce. We may not realize, in full or in part, the anticipated benefits, savings and improvements in our operating results from these efforts due to unforeseen difficulties, delays or unexpected costs. If we are unable to realize the expected operational efficiencies and cost savings, our operating results and financial condition would be adversely affected. We also cannot guarantee that we will not have to undertake additional workforce reductions in the future. Furthermore, our workforce reductions may be disruptive to our operations. For example, our workforce reductions could yield unanticipated consequences, such as attrition beyond planned staff reductions, increased difficulties in our day-to-day operations and reduced employee morale. In addition, while positions have been eliminated, certain functions necessary to our reduced operations remain, and we may be unsuccessful in distributing the duties and obligations of departed employees among our remaining employees. We may also discover that the reductions in workforce and cost cutting measures will make it difficult for us to pursue new opportunities and initiatives and require us to hire qualified replacement personnel, which may require us to incur additional and unanticipated costs and expenses. Moreover, there is no assurance we will be successful in our efforts. Our failure to successfully accomplish any of the above activities and goals may have a material adverse impact on our business, financial condition, and results of operations. \\n\\nIf we fail to effectively expand or optimize our manufacturing and production capacity, accurately forecast demand for our products or quickly respond to forecast changes, our business and operating results and our brand reputation could be harmed. \\n\\nIf we do not have sufficient capacity to meet our customers&#8217; demands and to satisfy increased demand, or are not able to streamline and optimize manufacturing capacity for specific products, we will need to expand our operations, supply and manufacturing capabilities. However, there is risk in our ability to effectively scale production processes, optimize manufacturing capacity for specific products and effectively manage our supply chain requirements. We must accurately forecast demand for each of our products and inventory needs in order to ensure we have adequate available manufacturing capacity for each such product and to ensure we are effectively managing our inventory. Our forecasts are based on multiple assumptions which may cause our estimates to be inaccurate and affect our ability to obtain adequate manufacturing capacity (whether our own manufacturing capacity or co-manufacturing capacity) and adequate inventory supply in order to meet the \\n\\ndemand for our products, which could prevent us from meeting increased customer demand and harm our brand and our business and in some cases may result in fines or indemnification obligations we must pay customers or distributors if we are unable to fulfill orders placed by them in a timely manner or at all. \\n\\nConsumer demand for plant-based meat products has recently cooled down. For example, in the fourth quarter of 2022, all of our markets and channels were negatively impacted by softness in demand. If consumer demand for plant-based meats continues to decrease, or if any such decrease is prolonged, demand for our products by our customers may also decrease, which could in turn have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. \\n\\nFurthermore, if we do not accurately align our manufacturing capabilities and inventory supply with demand, if we experience disruptions or delays in our supply chain, or if we cannot obtain raw materials of sufficient quantity and quality at reasonable prices and in a timely manner, our business, financial condition and results of operations may be materially adversely affected. \\n\\nWe may not be able to utilize our capacity efficiently or accurately plan our capacity requirements, which may adversely affect our gross margin, business and operating results. \\n\\nIf we overestimate our demand and overbuild our capacity or inventory, we may have significantly underutilized assets. Underutilization of our manufacturing and/or co-manufacturing facilities can adversely affect our gross margin and other operating results. If demand for our products experiences a prolonged decrease, we may be required to terminate or make penalty-type payments under certain supply chain arrangements, close or idle facilities and write down our long-lived assets or shorten the useful lives of underutilized assets and accelerate depreciation, which would increase our expenses. \\n\\nIf demand does not materialize at the rate forecasted, we may not be able to scale back our manufacturing expenses or overhead costs quickly enough to correspond to the lower than expected demand. This could result in lower margins and adversely impact our business and results of operations. Additionally, if product demand decreases or we fail to forecast demand accurately, our results may be adversely impacted due to higher costs resulting from lower manufacturing utilization, causing higher fixed costs per unit produced. Further, we may be required to recognize excess or obsolete inventory write-off charges, or excess capacity charges, which would have a negative impact on our results of operations. \\n\\nIf we are unable to sell our inventory in a timely manner, it could become obsolete, which could require us to write-down or write-off obsolete inventory, which could harm our operating results. \\n\\nThere is a risk that we may be unable to sell our inventory in a timely manner to avoid it becoming obsolete. If we are required to substantially discount our inventory or are unable to sell our inventory in a timely manner, we would be required to increase our inventory reserves or write off obsolete inventory and our operating results could be substantially harmed. Alternatively, we may be required to mark down certain products to sell any excess inventory or to sell such inventory through liquidation channels at significantly lower prices, which would negatively impact our business and operating results. In the year ended December 31, 2022, our net revenues were negatively impacted by strategic price reductions, and our gross profit was negatively impacted by higher inventory reserves, which increased costs per pound. \\n\\nOur ability to accurately forecast our future results of operations is subject to many risks and uncertainties and our operating and financial results could differ materially from our expectations. \\n\\nOur ability to accurately forecast our future results of operations is limited and subject to a number of risks and uncertainties. Our historical revenue growth should not be considered indicative of our future performance and our revenue growth could slow or our revenue could decline for a number of reasons, including slowing demand for our products, increasing competition from our market competitors and new market entrants, and a decrease in the growth of our overall market. In fact, net revenues in the year ended December 31, 2022 decreased by $45.8 million, or 9.8%, as compared to the prior year. If we are unable to identify and execute cost-down initiatives intended to achieve price parity with animal protein, we may not be able to compete effectively in our market, demand for our products may continue to slow and could continue to adversely affect \\n\\nour revenues and margins. If our assumptions regarding these risks and uncertainties and our future revenue growth are incorrect or change, or if we do not address these risks successfully, our operating and financial results could differ materially from our expectations, and our business could suffer. \\n\\nFrom time to time, we may release earnings guidance, financial goals or other forward-looking statements in our earnings releases, earnings conference calls or otherwise regarding our future performance that represent our management&#8217;s estimates as of the date of the release. Some or all of the assumptions of any future guidance or financial goals that we furnish may not materialize or may vary significantly from actual future results. For example, our ability to meet our cash flow positive targets is subject to a number of assumptions and uncertainties, including, without limitation, our ability to reduce costs and achieve positive gross margins; our ability to meet certain revenue and operating expense targets, which may be subject to factors beyond our control; and our ability to monetize inventory and manage working capital. \\n\\nWe estimate market opportunity and forecast market growth that may prove to be inaccurate, and even if the market in which we compete achieves the forecasted growth, our business could fail to grow at similar rates, if at all. \\n\\nOur estimates of market opportunity and growth forecasts are subject to significant uncertainty and are based on assumptions and estimates that may prove to be inaccurate. The factors that go into the calculation of our market opportunity are subject to change over time and may be variable or inaccurate and may be affected by increasing competition from our market competitors and new market entrants. Any expansion in our market depends on a number of factors, including the cost and perceived value associated with our product and those of our competitors. Even if the market in which we compete meets the size estimates and growth forecast, our business could fail to grow at the rate we anticipate, if at all. Our growth is subject to many factors, including our success in implementing our business strategy, which is subject to many risks and uncertainties. \\n\\nBecause we rely on a limited number of third-party suppliers, we may not be able to obtain raw materials on a timely basis or in sufficient quantities at competitive prices to produce our products or meet the demand for our products. \\n\\nWe rely on a limited number of vendors, a portion of which are located internationally, to supply us with raw materials. Our financial performance depends in large part on our ability to arrange for the purchase of raw materials in sufficient quantities at competitive prices. We have entered into a multi-year sales agreement for plant-based protein with one of our pea protein suppliers pursuant to which we are required to purchase specified minimum monthly and semi-annual quantities through the term. In addition, we have entered into a supply agreement with another supplier pursuant to which we obtain pea protein on a purchase order basis and have the right to cancel purchase orders if we provide timely written notice. The amount purchased in each quarter of 2023 is mutually agreed upon by us and the supplier prior to each quarter and becomes a binding quarterly commitment upon such agreement. Other than pursuant to these agreements, we are not assured of continued supply or pricing of raw materials. Any of our other suppliers could discontinue or seek to alter their relationship with us. We have in the past experienced interruptions in the supply of pea protein from one supplier that resulted in delays in delivery to us. We could experience similar delays in the future from any of our suppliers. Any disruption in the supply of pea protein or other raw materials would have a material adverse effect on our business if we cannot replace these suppliers in a timely manner, on commercially reasonable terms, or at all. \\n\\nIn addition, our pea protein suppliers manufacture their products at a limited number of facilities. A natural disaster, severe weather, fire, power interruption, work stoppage or other calamity affecting any of these facilities, or any interruption in their operations, could negatively impact our ability to obtain required quantities of pea protein in a timely manner, or at all, which could materially reduce our product sales and net revenues, and have a material adverse effect on our business and financial condition. \\n\\nEvents that adversely affect our suppliers of pea protein and other raw materials could impair our ability to obtain raw material inventory in the quantities at competitive prices that we desire. Such events include problems with our suppliers&#8217; businesses, finances, labor relations and/or shortages, strikes or other labor \\n\\nunrest, ability to import raw materials, product quality issues, costs, production, insurance and reputation, as well as local economic and political conditions, restrictive U.S. and foreign governmental actions, such as restrictions on transfers of funds and trade protection measures, including export/import duties and quotas and customs duties and tariffs, adverse fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates, changes in legal or regulatory requirements, border closures, disease outbreaks or pandemics (such as COVID-19), acts of war, terrorism, natural disasters, fires, earthquakes, flooding, severe weather, agricultural diseases or other catastrophic occurrences. We continuously seek alternative sources of protein to use in our products, but we may not be successful in diversifying the raw materials we use in our products. \\n\\nIf we need to replace an existing supplier, there can be no assurance that supplies of raw materials will be available when required on acceptable terms, or at all, or that a new supplier would allocate sufficient capacity to us in order to meet our requirements, fill our orders in a timely manner or meet our strict quality standards. If we are unable to manage our supply chain effectively and ensure that our products are available to meet consumer demand, we may not be able to fulfill customer orders, our operating costs could increase and our profit margins could decrease. \\n\\nDisruptions of our supply chain could have a material adverse effect on our operating and financial results. \\n\\nOur ability to make, move and sell products in coordination with our suppliers, third party contract manufacturers and distributors is critical to our success. Damage or disruption to our collective supply, manufacturing or distribution capabilities resulting from severe weather, fires or evacuations related thereto, natural disasters, including climate-related events, pandemics (such as the COVID-19 pandemic) or other outbreaks of contagious diseases, agricultural diseases, cyber incidents, terrorism, governmental restrictions or mandates, political instability, trade restrictions, import restrictions, border closures, freight carrier availability, labor shortages, strikes or other labor unrest, the financial or operational instability of key suppliers and carriers, repairs or enhancements at facilities manufacturing or delivering our products or other reasons could impair our ability to source inputs or manufacture, sell or timely deliver our products. To the extent we are unable to mitigate the likelihood or potential impact of such events, there could be a material adverse effect on our operating and financial results. \\n\\nAdditionally, there are increasing expectations in various jurisdictions that companies monitor the environmental and social performance of their suppliers, including compliance with a variety of labor practices, as well as consider a wider range of potential environmental and social matters, including the end of life considerations for products. Compliance can be costly, require us to establish or augment programs to diligence or monitor our suppliers, or, in the case of legislation such as the Uyghur Forced Labor Prevention Act, to design supply chains to avoid certain suppliers or regions altogether. Failure to comply with such regulations can result in fines, reputational damage, import ineligibility for certain products or raw materials, or otherwise adversely impact our business. \\n\\nOur future business, results of operations and financial condition may be adversely affected by reduced or limited availability of plant-based protein that meets our standards. \\n\\nOur ability to ensure a continuing supply of ingredients at competitive prices depends on many factors beyond our control, such as the number and size of farms that grow certain crops such as Canadian, European and North American yellow peas, the vagaries of these farming businesses (including poor harvests impacting the quality of the peas grown), changes in national and world economic conditions, including as a result of COVID-19 or the outbreak of hostilities or war, tariffs and our ability to forecast our ingredient requirements. The high-quality ingredients used in many of our products are vulnerable to adverse weather conditions and natural disasters, such as floods, droughts, frosts, earthquakes, hurricanes and pestilence. Adverse weather conditions and natural disasters can lower crop yields and reduce crop size and quality, which in turn could reduce the available supply of, or increase the price of, quality ingredients. In addition, we purchase some ingredients and other materials offshore, and the price and availability of such ingredients and materials may be affected by political events or other conditions in these countries or tariffs, trade wars or the outbreak of hostilities or war. We also compete with other food producers in the procurement of ingredients, and this competition may \\n\\nincrease in the future if consumer demand for plant-based meat products increases. If supplies of quality ingredients are reduced or there is greater demand for such ingredients from us and others, we may not be able to obtain sufficient supply that meets our strict quality standards on favorable terms, or at all, which could impact our ability to supply products and may adversely affect our business, results of operations and financial condition. \\n\\nWe rely on a limited number of distributors, and if we experience the loss of one or more distributors and cannot replace them in a timely manner, our results of operations may be adversely affected. \\n\\nMany retailers and foodservice providers purchase our products through distributors who purchase, store, sell, and deliver our products to such retailers and foodservice providers. For 2022, DOT accounted for 12% of our gross revenues. For 2021, DOT and Zandbergen WFM accounted for approximately 12% and 11% of our gross revenues, respectively. Since these distributors act as intermediaries between us and the retailers and foodservice providers, we do not have short-term or long-term commitments or minimum purchase volumes in our contracts with them that ensure future sales of our products. If we lose one or more of our distributors and cannot replace the distributor in a timely manner or at all, our business, results of operation and financial condition may be materially adversely affected. \\n\\nIf we fail to cost-effectively acquire new customers or retain our existing customers, or if we fail to derive revenue from our existing customers consistent with our historical performance, our business could be materially adversely affected. \\n\\nOur success, and our ability to increase revenues and operate profitably, depends in part on our ability to cost-effectively acquire new customers, to retain existing customers, and to keep existing customers engaged so that they continue to purchase products from us. We intend to continue to expand our number of foodservice customers, both in the United States and internationally, as part of our growth strategy. This may require us to provide marketing and other financial incentives to our customers to assist in the promotion of our products. Such additional incentives could have a negative impact on gross margin and may not necessarily result in increased sales. In addition, new national foodservice customers will often initially add certain of our product offerings to their menus at limited locations and/or on a limited test basis, after which time these customers may choose to no longer offer our products or may ultimately scale back subsequent expansions. If we fail to attract and retain new foodservice customers, or retain our existing foodservice customers, our business, financial condition and results of operations could be materially adversely affected. In addition, timing of retail shelf resets are not within our control, and to the extent that retail customers change the timing of such events, reduce our in store-displays or are not able to restock our products effectively, sales of our products may be impaired and negatively impact our revenues. \\n\\nFurther, if customers do not perceive our product offerings to be of sufficient value and quality, or if we fail to offer new and relevant product offerings at a competitive price, we may not be able to attract or retain customers or engage existing customers so that they continue to purchase products from us. We may lose customers to our competitors if they offer superior products to ours, if we are unable to compete on the basis of value and taste, if we are unable to meet customers&#8217; orders in a timely manner, or if we are unable to identify and execute cost-down initiatives intended to achieve price parity with animal protein. The loss of any large customer or the reduction of purchasing levels or the cancellation of business from such customers could have a material adverse impact on our business. \\n\\nConsolidation of customers or the loss of a significant customer could negatively impact our sales and profitability. \\n\\nSupermarkets in North America and the European Union continue to consolidate. This consolidation has produced larger, more sophisticated organizations with increased negotiating and buying power that are able to resist price increases, as well as operate with lower inventories, decrease the number of brands that they carry and increase their emphasis on private label products, all of which could negatively impact our business. The consolidation of retail customers also increases the risk that a significant adverse impact on their business could have a corresponding material adverse impact on our business. \\n\\nThe loss of any large customer, the reduction of purchasing levels or the cancellation of any business from a large customer for an extended length of time could negatively impact our sales and profitability. For example, in 2022, the year-over-year decrease in our U.S. foodservice channel net revenues was driven primarily by sales to a large QSR customer in the year-ago period that did not repeat in the fourth quarter of 2022. \\n\\nFurthermore, as retailers consolidate, they may reduce the number of branded products they offer in order to accommodate private label products and generate more competitive terms from branded suppliers competing for limited retailer shelf space. Consequently, our financial results may fluctuate significantly from period to period based on the actions of one or more significant retailers. A retailer may take actions that affect us for reasons that we cannot always anticipate or control, such as their financial condition, changes in their business strategy or operations, the introduction of competing products, pricing and promotions, shelf reset timing and activity, reduced in store-displays, timing of product restocking or the perceived quality of our products. Despite operating in different channels, our retailers sometimes compete for the same consumers as our foodservice channel. Because of actual or perceived conflicts resulting from this competition, retailers may take actions that negatively affect us. \\n\\nLoss of one or more of our co-manufacturers or our failure to timely identify and establish relationships with new co-manufacturers could harm our business and impede our growth. \\n\\nA significant amount of our revenue is derived from products manufactured at manufacturing facilities owned and operated by our co-manufacturers, a portion of which are located internationally. Any of the co-manufacturers with whom we do not have a written contract could seek to alter or terminate its relationship with us at any time, leaving us with periods during which we have limited or no ability to manufacture our products. If we need to replace a co-manufacturer, there can be no assurance that additional capacity will be available when required on acceptable terms, or at all. \\n\\nAn interruption in, or the loss of operations at, one or more of our co-manufacturing facilities, which may be caused by work stoppages, labor shortages, strikes or other labor unrest, production disruptions, product quality issues, local economic and political conditions, restrictive governmental actions, border closures, disease outbreaks or pandemics (such as COVID-19), the outbreak of hostilities, acts of war, terrorism, fire, earthquakes, severe weather, flooding or other natural disasters at one or more of these facilities, could delay, postpone or reduce production of some of our products, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition until such time as such interruption is resolved or an alternate source of production is secured. \\n\\nWe believe there are a limited number of competent, high-quality co-manufacturers in the industry that meet our strict quality and control standards, and as we seek to continue to obtain additional or alternative co-manufacturing arrangements in the future, there can be no assurance that we would be able to do so on satisfactory terms, in a timely manner, or at all. Additionally, as we expand our operations internationally, we will need to develop relationships with co-manufacturers overseas to meet sales demand, and there can be no assurance that we will be able to successfully do so. Therefore, the loss of one or more co-manufacturers, any disruption or delay at a co-manufacturer or any failure to identify and engage co-manufacturers for new products, product extensions and expanded operations could delay, postpone or reduce production of our products, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition. \\n\\nAny damage or disruption at our domestic or international manufacturing facilities may harm our business. \\n\\nWe have manufacturing facilities in the United States, China and the Netherlands to produce our woven proteins and our finished goods. A natural disaster, severe weather, fire, power interruption, work stoppage, labor shortages, strikes or other labor unrest, border closures, restrictive governmental actions, outbreaks of pandemics or contagious diseases (such as COVID-19) or other calamity at any of these facilities would significantly disrupt our ability to deliver our products and operate our business. If any material amount of our machinery or inventory were damaged, we would be unable to meet our contractual obligations and cannot \\n\\npredict when, if at all, we could replace or repair such machinery, which could materially adversely affect our business, financial condition and operating results. \\n\\nOur business could be adversely affected by a workplace accident or safety incident. \\n\\nOur manufacturing processes and related activities could expose us to significant personal injury claims that could subject us to substantial liability. Specifically, our inability to anticipate or preempt potential workplace hazards, create safe working environments or timely adapt to changing requirements around maintaining a safe workplace could result in employee illness, accidents or other safety incidents. A failure to properly train our employees regarding, or respond appropriately and in a timely manner to, any such illness, accident or safety incident could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operation and reputation. While we maintain liability insurance in amounts and of the type generally consistent with industry practice, the amount of such coverage may not be adequate to cover fully all claims, and we may be forced to bear substantial losses from an accident or safety incident resulting from our manufacturing activities. \\n\\nWe may not successfully ramp up operations at our facilities or these facilities may not operate in accordance with our expectations. Moreover, we face competition for employees and may be unable to hire and retain employees at these facilities. \\n\\nSince June 2018, we have acquired facilities by purchase or lease in the United States, China and the Netherlands. Any substantial delay in bringing these facilities up to full production on our current schedule may hinder our ability to produce all of the product needed to meet orders and/or achieve our expected financial performance. Opening these facilities has required, and will continue to require, additional capital expenditures and the efforts and attention of our management and other personnel, which has and will continue to divert resources from our existing business or operations. These efforts may prove more expensive than we anticipate, and we may not succeed in increasing our revenues and margins sufficiently to offset the anticipated higher expenses. Additionally, our inability to hire and retain skilled employees at these facilities will severely hamper our expansion plans, product development and manufacturing efforts. The unemployment rate in the Columbia, Missouri market was 2.8% as of December 2022 and labor market conditions remain relatively tight. As a result, we currently rely on temporary workers in addition to full-time employees, and in the future, we may be unable to attract and retain employees with the skills we require, which could impact our ability to expand our operations. Even if our facilities are brought up to full production according to our current schedule, it may not provide us with all of the operational and financial benefits we expect to receive. \\n\\nOur facilities and the manufacturing equipment we use to produce our products is costly to replace or repair and may require substantial lead-time to do so. For example, our estimate of throughput or our extrusion capacity may be impacted by disruption from extruder lead-in time, calibration, maintenance and unexpected delays. In addition, our ability to procure new extruders may face more lengthy lead times than is typical. We may also not be able to find suitable alternatives with co-manufacturers to replace the output from such equipment on a timely basis and at a reasonable cost. In the future, we may also experience plant shutdowns or periods of reduced production because of regulatory issues, equipment failure, delays in raw material deliveries or other adverse events. Any such disruption or unanticipated event may cause significant interruptions or delays in our business and the reduction or loss of inventory may render us unable to fulfill customer orders in a timely manner, or at all. We have property and business disruption insurance in place for all of our manufacturing facilities; however, such insurance coverage may not be sufficient to cover all of our potential losses and may not continue to be available to us on acceptable terms, or at all. \\n\\nWe may face difficulties as we expand our operations in other countries, including into those in which we have no prior operating experience. \\n\\nWe intend to continue to expand our global footprint and enter into new markets. International operations involve a number of risks, including labor shortages, strikes or other labor unrest, border closures, restrictive governmental actions, foreign regulatory compliance, tariffs, taxes and exchange controls, economic downturns, inflation, foreign currency fluctuations and political and social instability in the countries in which we operate. Expansion may involve expanding into countries other than those in which we currently operate. It may also involve expanding into less developed countries, which may have less political, social or economic stability and less developed infrastructure and legal systems. In addition, it may be difficult for us to understand and accurately predict taste preferences and purchasing habits of consumers in these new geographic markets. It is costly to establish, develop and maintain international operations and develop and promote our brands in international markets. As we expand our business into other countries, we may encounter regulatory, legal, personnel, technological and other difficulties that increase our expenses and/or delay our ability to become profitable in such countries, which may have a material adverse effect on our business and brand. \\n\\nOur revenue growth rate has fluctuated in recent periods and may continue to slow or decline in the future. \\n\\nWe experienced significant revenue growth in prior periods. However, our revenue growth and revenues have slowed or declined, with periods of negative growth, and may continue to slow or decline in future periods due to a number of potential factors, including without limitation, macroeconomic issues including inflation and rising interest rates, increasing concerns about the likelihood of a recession, and potential impacts on consumer and customer behavior, and demand levels, increasing competition, market saturation, slowing demand for our offerings, increasing regulatory costs and challenges, failure to capitalize on growth opportunities and the long-term effects of the COVID-19 pandemic. \\n\\nOur revenues and earnings may fluctuate as a result of our promotional activities. \\n\\nWe routinely offer sales discounts and promotions through various programs to customers and consumers which may result in reduced margins. These programs include rebates, temporary on-shelf price reductions, off-invoice discounts, retailer advertisements, product coupons and other trade activities. We anticipate that we will need to continue to offer more trade and promotion discounts to both our retail and foodservice customers, to drive increased consumer trial and in response to changing consumer behavior and increased competition. We expect to face increasing competition across all channels, especially as additional plant-based meat product brands continue to enter the marketplace. In response, we anticipate providing heavier discounting and promotions on some of our products. Although these actions are intended to build brand awareness and increase consumer trials of our products, they have had and are likely to continue to have a negative impact on our net revenues, gross profit, gross margin and profitability, impacting period-over-period results. \\n\\nFluctuations in our results of operations for our second and third quarters may impact, and may have a disproportionate effect on our overall financial condition and results of operations. \\n\\nOur business is subject to seasonal fluctuations that may have a disproportionate effect on our results of operations. Generally, we expect to experience greater demand for certain of our products during the summer grilling season. We continue to see additional seasonality effects, especially within our retail channel, with revenue contribution from this channel tending to be greater in the second and third quarters of the year, along with increased levels of purchasing by customers ahead of holidays, the impact of customer shelf reset activity and the timing of product restocking by our retail customers. Any factors that harm our second and third quarter operating results, including disruptions in our supply chain, adverse weather or unfavorable economic conditions, may have a disproportionate effect on our results of operations for the entire year. In an environment of recessionary and inflationary pressures, general softness in the plant-based category, competition and other factors impacting our business, including uncertainty around the long-term impacts of COVID-19, we are unable to assess the ultimate impact on the demand for our products as a result of seasonality. \\n\\nHistorical results are not indicative of future results. \\n\\nHistorical quarter-to-quarter and period-over-period comparisons of our sales and operating results are not necessarily indicative of future quarter-to-quarter and period-over-period results. You should not rely on the results of a single quarter or period as an indication of our annual results or our future performance. \\n\\nFailure by our transportation providers to deliver our products on time, or at all, could result in lost sales. \\n\\nWe currently rely upon third-party transportation providers for a significant portion of our product shipments. Our utilization of delivery services for shipments is subject to risks, including increases in fuel prices, which would increase our shipping costs, employee strikes, disease outbreaks or pandemics (such as COVID-19) and inclement weather, which may impact the ability of providers to provide delivery services that adequately meet our shipping needs, if at all. We periodically change shipping companies, and we could face logistical difficulties that could adversely affect deliveries. In addition, we could incur costs and expend resources in connection with such change. Moreover, we may not be able to obtain terms as favorable as those we receive from the third-party transportation providers that we currently use, which in turn would increase our costs and thereby adversely affect our operating results. \\n\\nWe have undergone, and may continue to experience, changes to our executive leadership team and senior management, and if we are unable to integrate new members of our executive leadership team or senior management, or if we fail to retain members of our executive leadership team and senior management, our business and operations may be adversely affected. \\n\\nOur success is substantially dependent on the continued service of certain members of our senior management, including Ethan Brown, our Founder, President and Chief Executive Officer. These executives have been primarily responsible for determining the strategic direction of our business and for executing our growth strategy and are integral to our brand, culture and the reputation we enjoy with suppliers, co-manufacturers, distributors, customers and consumers. The loss of the services of any of these executives could have a material adverse effect on our business and prospects, as we may not be able to find suitable individuals to replace them on a timely basis, if at all. In addition, any such departure could be viewed in a negative light by investors and analysts, which may cause the price of our common stock to decline. We do not currently carry key-person life insurance for our senior executives. \\n\\nFrom time to time, there may be changes in our executive leadership team and senior management as a result of the hiring, departure or realignment of key personnel, and such changes may impact our business. In 2021 and 2022, we have had several changes to our executive leadership team and senior management, including as a result of organizational changes based on cost-reduction initiatives. Any significant leadership change or senior management transition involves inherent risk and any failure to ensure the timely and suitable replacement and a smooth transition could hinder our strategic planning, business execution and future performance. In particular, these or any future leadership transitions may result in a loss of personnel with deep institutional or technical knowledge and changes in business strategy or objectives and have the potential to disrupt our operations and relationships with employees and customers due to added costs, operational inefficiencies, changes in strategy, decreased employee morale and productivity, and increased turnover. If we are unable to successfully integrate new executive leadership team members and senior management, our operations may be adversely affected and we may not be able to achieve our operating objectives. \\n\\nIf we are unable to attract, train and retain employees or maintain our company culture, we may not be able to grow or successfully operate our business. \\n\\nOur success depends in part upon our ability to attract, train and retain a sufficient number of employees who understand and appreciate our culture and can represent our brand effectively and establish credibility with our business partners and consumers. We believe a critical component of our success has been our company culture and long-standing core values. We have invested substantial time and resources in building our team. If we are unable to hire and retain employees capable of meeting our business needs and expectations, or if we \\n\\nfail to preserve our company culture among a larger number of employees dispersed in various geographic regions, our business and brand image may be impaired. Any failure to meet our staffing needs or any material increase in turnover rates of our employees or key personnel changes may adversely affect our business, results of operations and financial condition. \\n\\nFurthermore, in 2022, we implemented two reductions in force, which together impacted 19% of our global workforce. Although we believe these reductions will be an important part of the success of our cost-reduction initiatives, they may adversely affect employee morale, our culture and our ability to attract and retain critical employees. They may also negatively impact our ability to pursue new initiatives due to insufficient resources and personnel. We may be unsuccessful in distributing duties and obligations of impacted employees among the remaining employees. We also may not realize the anticipated benefits and cost savings and may suffer unintended consequences, such as the loss of institutional knowledge, higher than expected employee turnover and significant disruptions in our day-to-day operations. If we are unable to realize the expected operational efficiencies or cost savings from the reductions in force, or if we experience significant adverse consequences as a result, our business, financial conditions and results of operations may be adversely affected. \\n\\nSome of our international employees are employed by professional employer organizations. \\n\\nPrior to January 1, 2022, we contracted with a professional employer organization, or U.S. PEO, that administered our human resources, payroll and employee benefits functions for our employees in the United States. Effective as of January 1, 2022, such human resources, payroll and employee benefits functions are no longer performed by the U.S. PEO. We continue to contract with non-U.S. PEOs to perform the same functions as the U.S. PEO for the majority of our employees outside the United States. Although we recruit and select our workers, each of these workers is also an employee of record of the relevant non-U.S. PEO. As a result, these workers are compensated through the relevant PEO, are governed by the work policies created by the relevant PEO and receive their annual wage statements and other payroll or labor related reports from the relevant PEO (e.g., T-4s for employees in Canada). This relationship permits management to focus on operations and profitability rather than payroll administration, but this relationship also exposes us to some risks. Among other risks, if any of the non-U.S. PEOs fail to adequately withhold or pay employer taxes or to comply with applicable laws, we may be held liable for such violations notwithstanding any indemnification provisions with the non-U.S. PEOs. In certain non-U.S. jurisdictions, the worker may be deemed a direct employee and the potential liability for any non-compliance with applicable laws increases depending on whether a company has an entity or other corporate presence in the country, among other factors set forth under applicable local laws. \\n\\nCourt and administrative proceedings related to matters of employment tax, labor law and other laws applicable to PEO arrangements could distract management from our business and cause us to incur significant expense. If we were held liable for violations by PEOs, such amounts may adversely affect our profitability and could negatively affect our business and results of operations. \\n\\nWe depend on a limited number of third party service providers for the performance of several of our business operations, including payroll and human capital management services. \\n\\nIf any of these third party providers were to experience significant interruptions in their business operations, terminate their agreements with the company, or fail to perform the services required under the terms of the company&#8217;s contracts with them, its own processing could be materially and adversely affected for an indefinite period of time. There can be no assurance that the company would be able to locate alternative providers of such services, or that it could do so at economical rates. \\n\\nFuture acquisitions or investments could disrupt our business and harm our financial condition. \\n\\nIn the future, we may pursue acquisitions or investments that we believe will help us achieve our strategic objectives. We may not be able to find suitable acquisition candidates, and even if we do, we may not be able to complete acquisitions on favorable terms, if at all. If we do complete acquisitions, we may not ultimately achieve our goals or realize the anticipated benefits. The pursuit of acquisitions and any integration process will require significant time and resources and could divert management time and focus from operation of our then-existing \\n\\nbusiness, and we may not be able to manage the process successfully. Any acquisitions we complete could be viewed negatively by our customers or consumers. An acquisition, investment or business relationship may result in unforeseen operating difficulties and expenditures, including disrupting our ongoing operations and subjecting us to additional liabilities, increasing our expenses, and adversely impacting our business, financial condition and operating results. Moreover, we may be exposed to unknown liabilities related to the acquired company or product, and the anticipated benefits of any acquisition, investment or business relationship may not be realized if, for example, we fail to successfully integrate such acquisition into our company. To pay for any such acquisitions, we would have to use cash, incur debt, or issue debt or equity securities, each of which may affect our financial condition or the value of our common stock and could result in dilution to our stockholders. If we incur more debt it would result in increased fixed obligations and could also subject us to covenants or other restrictions that would impede our ability to manage our operations. Our acquisition strategy could require significant management attention, disrupt our business and harm our business, financial condition and results of operations. \\n\\nOur business and reputation could be negatively impacted by the increased scrutiny from our stakeholders and institutional investors on ESG practices. \\n\\nThere is an increased focus from a variety of stakeholders on corporate ESG practices, including climate change and related ESG disclosure requirements. Expectations regarding voluntary ESG initiatives and disclosures may result in increased costs (including but not limited to increased costs related to compliance, stakeholder engagement, contracting and insurance), changes in demand for certain products, enhanced compliance or disclosure obligations, or other adverse impacts to our business, financial condition, or results of operations. \\n\\nWhile we may at times engage in voluntary initiatives (such as voluntary disclosures, certifications, or goals, among others) to improve the ESG profile of our company and/or products, such initiatives or achievements of such commitments may be costly and may not have the desired effect. Expectations around the Company&#8217;s management of ESG matters continues to evolve rapidly, in many instances due to factors that are out of our control. For example, we may not ultimately be able to complete certain goals or initiatives, either on the timelines originally anticipated or at all, due to technical, cost, or other factors, which may be in or out of our control. Moreover, actions or statements that we may take based on based on expectations, assumptions, or third-party information that we currently believe to be reasonable may subsequently be determined to be erroneous or be subject to misinterpretation. Even if this is not the case, our current actions may subsequently be determined to be insufficient by various stakeholders, and we may be subject to investor or regulator engagement on our ESG initiatives and disclosures, even if such initiatives are currently voluntary. \\n\\nCertain market participants, including stockholders and other capital providers, use third-party benchmarks or scores to measure a company&#8217;s ESG practices and decide whether to invest in their common stock or engage with them to require changes to their practices. In addition, certain influential institutional investors are also increasing their focus on ESG practices and are placing importance on the implications and social cost of their investments. If our ESG practices do not meet the standards set by these stockholders, they may choose not to invest in our common stock or if our peer companies outperform us in their ESG initiatives, potential or current investors may elect to invest with our competitors instead. Increasing governmental and societal attention to ESG matters, including expanding mandatory and voluntary reporting, diligence and disclosure on topics such as climate change, human capital, labor and risk oversight, could also expand the nature, scope and complexity of matters that we are required to control, assess and report. For example, to the extent ESG matters negatively impact our reputation, it may also impede our ability to compete as effectively to attract and retain employees, customers, or business partners, which may adversely impact our operations. We may be especially subject to scrutiny on such matters given efforts to portray our operations and products as a more sustainable and conscientious alternative to certain competitor products. As another example, the SEC has proposed rules that would require companies to provide significantly expanded climate-related disclosures in their periodic reporting, which may require us to incur significant additional costs to comply, including the implementation of significant additional internal controls processes and procedures regarding matters that have not been subject to such controls in the past, and impose increased oversight obligations on our management \\n\\nand board of directors. These and other regulations, disclosure-related and otherwise, may increase our costs as well as increase scrutiny regarding our ESG efforts, which may enhance the risks discussed in this risk factor. If we do not comply with investor or stockholder expectations and standards in connection with our ESG initiatives, are perceived to have not responded appropriately to address ESG issues within our company, or fail to adapt to or comply with all laws, regulations, policies and related interpretations, our business and reputation could be negatively impacted and our share price and access to/cost of capital could be materially and adversely affected. Additionally, many of our customers and suppliers may be subject to similar expectations, which may augment or create additional risks, including risks that may not be known to us. \\n\\nThe Company is subject to accounting estimate risks. \\n\\nThe preparation of the Company&#8217;s consolidated financial statements in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles requires management to make significant estimates that affect the financial statements. Estimates are made at specific points in time and based on facts, historical experience and various other factors believed to be reasonable under the circumstances at such time. If actual results differ from our judgments and assumptions, then it may have an adverse impact on the results of our operations and cash flows. \\n\\nRisks Related to Our Products \\n\\nFood safety and food-borne illness incidents may materially adversely affect our business by exposing us to lawsuits, product recalls or regulatory enforcement actions, increasing our operating costs and reducing demand for our product offerings. \\n\\nSelling food for human consumption involves inherent legal and other risks, and there is increasing governmental scrutiny of and public awareness regarding food safety. Unexpected side effects, illness, injury or death related to allergens, food-borne illnesses or other food safety incidents caused by products we sell, or involving our suppliers or co-manufacturers, could result in the discontinuance of sales of these products or our relationships with such suppliers or co-manufacturers, or otherwise result in increased operating costs, regulatory enforcement actions or harm to our reputation. Shipment of adulterated or misbranded products, even if inadvertent, can result in criminal or civil liability. Such incidents could also expose us to product liability, negligence or other lawsuits, including consumer class action lawsuits. Any claims brought against us may exceed or be outside the scope of our existing or future insurance policy coverage or limits. Any judgment against us that is more than our policy limits or not covered by our policies or not subject to insurance would have to be paid from our cash reserves, which would reduce our capital resources. \\n\\nThe occurrence of food-borne illnesses or other food safety incidents could also adversely affect the price and availability of affected ingredients, resulting in higher costs, disruptions in supply and a reduction in our sales. Furthermore, any instances of food contamination or regulatory noncompliance, whether or not caused by our actions, could compel us, our suppliers, our distributors or our customers, depending on the circumstances, to conduct a recall in accordance with FDA regulations, comparable state laws or foreign laws such as those of the European Union, the United Kingdom and China. Food recalls could result in significant losses due to their costs, the destruction of product inventory, lost sales due to the unavailability of the product for a period of time and potential loss of existing distributors or customers and a potential negative impact on our ability to attract new customers due to negative consumer experiences or because of an adverse impact on our brand and reputation. The costs of a recall could exceed or be outside the scope of our existing or future insurance policy coverage or limits. \\n\\nIn addition, food companies have been subject to targeted, large-scale tampering as well as to opportunistic, individual product tampering, and we, like any food company, could be a target for product tampering. Forms of tampering could include the introduction of foreign material, chemical contaminants and pathological organisms into consumer products as well as product substitution. FDA regulations require companies like us to analyze, prepare and implement mitigation strategies specifically to address tampering (i.e., intentional adulteration) designed to inflict widespread public health harm. If we do not adequately address the possibility, or any actual instance, of intentional adulteration, we could face possible seizure or recall of our \\n\\nproducts and the imposition of civil or criminal sanctions, which could materially adversely affect our business, financial condition and operating results. \\n\\nConsumer preferences for our products are difficult to predict and may change, and, if we are unable to respond quickly to new trends and demands, our business may be adversely affected. \\n\\nOur business is focused on the development, manufacture, marketing and distribution of a line of branded plant-based meat products as alternatives to animal-based protein products. Consumer demand could change based on a number of possible factors, including dietary habits and nutritional values, concerns regarding the health effects of ingredients and shifts in preference for various product attributes. If consumer demand for our products decreased, our business and financial condition would suffer. In addition, sales of plant-based meat or meat-alternative products are subject to evolving consumer preferences that we may not be able to accurately predict or respond to. Consumer trends that we believe favor sales of our products could change based on a number of possible factors, including a shift in preference from plant-based meat to animal-based protein products (including any products produced using new farming methods or technologies which may reduce the adverse environmental and other factors associated with conventional animal-based protein products), increased acceptance for different alternative proteins that are used in our products, economic factors and social trends. A significant shift in consumer demand away from our products could reduce our sales or our market share and the prestige of our brand, which would harm our business and financial condition. \\n\\nAdditionally, lobbyists supporting the meat industry have engaged in marketing campaigns in an attempt to generate negative publicity regarding our products and may continue to do so in the future. Any shift in consumer perception that our products are not healthy as a result of these campaigns could significantly reduce the value of our brand and damage our business. Other types of adverse publicity concerning our business or the plant-based meat industry generally could also harm our brand, reputation and results of operations. The growing use of social and digital media over recent years has amplified the impact of such negative publicity. \\n\\nSales of the Beyond Burger contribute a significant portion of our revenue. A reduction in sales of Beyond Burger would have an adverse effect on our financial condition. \\n\\nBeyond Burger accounted for approximately 50%, 55% and 58% of our gross revenues in 2022, 2021 and 2020, respectively. The Beyond Burger is our flagship product and has historically been the focal point of our development and marketing efforts, and we believe that sales of the Beyond Burger will continue to constitute a significant portion of our revenues, income and cash flow for the foreseeable future. We cannot be certain that we will be able to continue to expand production and distribution of the Beyond Burger, or that customer demand for our other existing and future products will expand to allow such products to represent a larger percentage of our revenue than they do currently. Accordingly, any factor adversely affecting sales of the Beyond Burger could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. \\n\\nFailure to continually innovate and successfully introduce and commercialize new products or successfully improve existing products may adversely affect our ability to continue to grow. \\n\\nA key element of our long-term growth strategy depends on our ability to develop and market new products and improvements to our existing products that meet our standards for quality and appeal to consumer preferences. The success of our innovation and product development efforts is affected by our ability to anticipate changes in consumer preferences, accurately predict taste preferences and purchasing habits of consumers in new geographic markets, the technical capability of our innovation staff in developing and testing product prototypes, including complying with applicable governmental regulations, commercialization and scale-up of new products, and the success of our management and sales and marketing teams in introducing and marketing new products. Our innovation staff members are continuously testing alternative plant-based proteins to the proteins we currently use in our products, as they seek to find additional protein options to our current ingredients that are more easily sourced, and which retain and build upon the quality and appeal of our current product offerings. Failure to develop, commercialize and market new products that appeal to consumers may lead to a decrease in our growth, sales and profitability. \\n\\nAdditionally, the development and introduction of new products requires substantial research, development and marketing expenditures, which we may be unable to recoup if the new products do not gain widespread market acceptance. If we are unsuccessful in meeting our objectives with respect to new or improved products, our business could be harmed. \\n\\nIngredient and packaging costs are volatile and may rise significantly, which may negatively impact the profitability of our business. \\n\\nWe purchase large quantities of raw materials, including ingredients derived from Canadian, European and North American yellow peas, mung beans, sunflower seeds, rice, faba beans, canola oil and coconut oil. In addition, we purchase and use significant quantities of cardboard, film and plastic to package our products. Costs of ingredients and packaging are volatile and can fluctuate due to conditions that are difficult to predict, including global competition for resources, weather conditions, consumer demand and changes in governmental trade and agricultural programs. Volatility in the prices of raw materials and other supplies we purchase could increase our cost of sales and reduce our profitability. Moreover, we may not be able to implement price increases for our products to cover any increased costs, and any price increases we do implement may result in lower sales volumes. If we are not successful in managing our ingredient and packaging costs, if we are unable to increase our prices to cover increased costs or if such price increases reduce our sales volumes, then such increases in costs will adversely affect our business, results of operations and financial condition. \\n\\nRisks Related to Our Industry and Brand \\n\\nWe face intense competition in our market from our competitors, including manufacturers of animal-based meat products and other brands that produce plant-based meat products, and potential competitors and new market entrants and we may lack sufficient financial or other resources to compete successfully. \\n\\nOur future success depends, in large part, on our ability to implement our long-term growth strategy of expanding supply and distribution, improving placement of our products, attracting new consumers to our brand and introducing new products and product extensions, and expanding into new geographic markets. If we fail to implement this growth strategy or if we invest resources in a growth strategy that ultimately proves unsuccessful, our sales and operating results will be adversely affected. Our ability to implement this growth strategy depends, among other things, on our ability to: \\n\\n&#8226; manage relationships with various suppliers, co-manufacturers, distributors, customers and other third parties, and expend time and effort to integrate new suppliers, co-manufacturers, distributors and customers into our fulfillment operations; \\n\\n&#8226; continue to compete in retail and foodservice channels; \\n\\n&#8226; secure placement in the meat case for our products; \\n\\n&#8226; increase our brand recognition and expand and maintain brand loyalty; \\n\\n&#8226; develop new product lines and extensions; and \\n\\n&#8226; expand into new geographic markets. \\n\\nOur ability to implement our long-term growth strategy also depends on our ability to continue to compete in the retail and foodservice channels. We operate in a highly competitive environment. Numerous brands and products compete for limited retailer shelf space, foodservice customers and consumers. In our market, competition is based on, among other things, taste, nutritional profile, ingredients, texture, ease of integration into the consumer diet, low-carbohydrate, low-sugar, high fiber and protein, lack of cholesterol, soy, gluten and GMOs, convenience, price and promotion tactics, brand awareness and loyalty among customers, media spending, product variety and packaging, access to major retailer shelf space and retail locations, access to \\n\\nmajor foodservice outlets and integration into menus, innovation and intellectual property protection on products. \\n\\nIn response to increased competition, as well as the COVID-19 pandemic, we have recently been providing heavier discounting on some of our products. Although these actions are intended to build brand awareness and increase consumer trials of our products, they have had, and may continue to have, a negative impact on our net revenues, gross profit, gross margin and profitability, impacting period-over-period results. \\n\\nWe compete with conventional animal-protein companies such as Cargill, Hormel, JBS, Perdue Foods, Tyson and WH Group, who may have substantially greater financial and other resources than us and whose animal-based products are well-accepted in the marketplace today. They may also have lower operational costs, and as a result may be able to offer conventional animal meat to customers at lower costs than plant-based meat. This could cause us to lower our prices, resulting in lower profitability or, in the alternative, cause us to lose market share if we fail to lower prices. \\n\\nWe also compete with other food brands, including brands affiliated with conventional animal-protein companies and other large food operators, that develop and sell plant-based meat products, including, but not limited to, Alpha Foods, Boca Foods (Kraft Heinz), Lightlife and Field Roast Grain Meat Co. (Maple Leaf Foods), Gardein (Conagra), Hungry Planet, Inc., Impossible Foods, Incogmeato/Morningstar Farms (Kellogg), Moving Mountains, Omn!pork (OmniFoods), Tofurky, Sweet Earth and Awesome Burger (Nestle&#8217; S.A.), Pure Farmland by Smithfield Foods (WH Group), Raised &#38; Rooted (Tyson), Happy Little Plants (Hormel), Sysco&#8217;s Simply Plant-Based Meatless Burger, Tattooed Chef, The Not Company and Vegetarian Butcher (Unilever), and with companies which may be more innovative, have more resources and be able to bring new products to market faster and to more quickly exploit and serve niche markets. For example, a number of U.S. and international companies are working on developing lab-grown or &#8220;clean meat,&#8221; an animal-protein product cultivated from cells taken from animals, which could have a similar appeal to consumers as plant-based meat products. We compete with these competitors for foodservice customers, retailer shelf space and consumers. \\n\\nGenerally, the food industry is dominated by multinational corporations with substantially greater resources and operations than us. We cannot be certain that we will successfully compete with larger competitors that have greater financial, sales and technical resources or with new competitors and market entrants. Conventional food companies may acquire our competitors or launch their own plant-based meat products, and they may be able to use their resources and scale to respond to competitive pressures and changes in consumer preferences by introducing new products, reducing prices or increasing promotional activities, among other things. Retailers also market competitive products under their own private labels, which are generally sold at lower prices and compete with some of our products. Similarly, retailers could change the merchandising of our products and we may be unable to retain the placement of our products in meat cases to effectively compete with animal-protein products. Competitive pressures, new competitors and market entrants or other factors could cause us to lose market share, which may require us to lower prices, increase marketing and advertising expenditures, or increase the use of discounting or promotional campaigns, each of which would adversely affect our margins and could result in a decrease in our operating results and profitability. \\n\\nOur brand and reputation may be diminished due to real or perceived quality or health issues with our products, which could have an adverse effect on our business, reputation, operating results and financial condition. \\n\\nWe believe our consumers rely on us to provide them with high-quality plant-based meat products. Therefore, real or perceived quality or food safety concerns or failures to comply with applicable food regulations and requirements, whether or not ultimately based on fact and whether or not involving us (such as incidents involving our competitors), could cause negative publicity and reduced confidence in our company, brand or products, or the industry as a whole, which could in turn harm our reputation and sales, and could materially adversely affect our business, financial condition and operating results. Although we believe we have a rigorous quality control process, there can be no assurance that our products will always comply with the standards set for our products, and although we strive to keep our products free of pathogenic organisms, they may not be easily detected and cross-contamination can occur. For example, in 2017, before our products were \\n\\nshipped to distributors or customers, we discovered, through our quality control process, that certain of our products manufactured by a former co-manufacturer were contaminated with salmonella. There is no assurance that this health risk will always be preempted by our quality control processes. \\n\\nWe have no control over our products once purchased by consumers. Accordingly, consumers may prepare our products in a manner that is inconsistent with our directions or store our products for long periods of time, which may adversely affect the quality and safety of our products. If consumers do not perceive our products to be safe or of high quality, then the value of our brand would be diminished, and our business, results of operations and financial condition would be adversely affected. \\n\\nAny loss of confidence on the part of consumers in the ingredients used in our products or in the safety and quality of our products would be difficult and costly to overcome. Any such adverse effect could be exacerbated by our position in the market as a purveyor of high-quality plant-based meat products and may significantly reduce our brand value. Issues regarding the safety of any of our products, regardless of the cause, may have a substantial and adverse effect on our brand, reputation and operating results. \\n\\nThe growing use of social and digital media by us, our consumers and third parties increases the speed and extent that information or misinformation and opinions can be shared. Negative publicity about us, our brands or our products on social or digital media could seriously damage our brands and reputation. If we do not maintain the favorable perception of our brands, our sales and profits could be negatively impacted. \\n\\nIf we fail to develop and maintain our brand, our business could suffer. \\n\\nWe have developed a strong and trusted brand that has contributed significantly to the success of our business, and we believe our continued success depends on our ability to maintain and grow the value of the Beyond Meat brand. Maintaining, promoting and positioning our brand and reputation will depend on, among other factors, the success of our plant-based product offerings, food safety, quality assurance, marketing and merchandising efforts, the nutritional benefits provided by our products and our ability to provide a consistent, high-quality customer experience. Any negative publicity, regardless of its accuracy, could materially adversely affect our business, results of operation and reputation. Brand value is based on perceptions of subjective qualities, and any incident that erodes the loyalty of our customers, suppliers or co-manufacturers, including adverse publicity, negative media or a governmental investigation or litigation, could significantly reduce the value of our brand and significantly damage our business. \\n\\nRisks Related to Our International Operations \\n\\nOur international expansion into China and Europe could expose us to substantial business, regulatory, political, financial and economic risks. \\n\\nOur expansion into China and Europe could expose us to substantial risks associated with doing business in China and Europe, such as risks associated with taxation, inflation, environmental regulations, foreign currency exchange rates, the labor market, property and financial regulations, the COVID-19 pandemic or other public health crises, and the outbreak of hostilities or war. Our ability to operate in China and Europe may be adversely affected by changes in, or our failure to comply with, Chinese or European laws and regulations. In addition, we are exposed to risks associated with our workforce in China and the Netherlands, including with respect to changes in employment and labor laws, which could increase our operating costs. The departure of the United Kingdom from the European Union (commonly known as &#8220;Brexit&#8221;) on January 31, 2020 has created uncertainties affecting business operations in the U.K., EU and a number of other countries, which could increase volatility in exchange rates, market instability, costs and other risks. There is also significant uncertainty about the future relationship between the United States and China with respect to trade policies, treaties, government regulations and tariffs. \\n\\nFluctuations in currency exchange rates could negatively impact our earnings. \\n\\nA portion of our international business is conducted in currencies other than the U.S. dollar, and therefore changes in foreign exchange rates relative to the U.S. dollar have in the past, and may in the future, affect the \\n\\nvalue of our non&#8209;U.S. dollar net assets, revenues and expenses. Although we closely monitor potential exposures as a result of these fluctuations in currencies, and where cost&#8209;justified we adopt strategies that are designed to reduce the impact of these fluctuations on our financial performance, there can be no assurance that we will be successful in managing our foreign exchange risk. Our exposure to currency exchange rate fluctuations will grow if the relative contribution of our operations outside the United States increases. Any material fluctuations in currencies could have a material effect on our financial condition, results of operations and cash flows. \\n\\nOur international operations are subject to the FCPA and we could be adversely affected by violations of the FCPA and similar worldwide anti-corruption laws. \\n\\nThe FCPA and similar worldwide anti-corruption laws generally prohibit companies and their intermediaries from making certain improper payments for the purpose of obtaining or retaining business. The continued expansion of our international operations could increase the risk of violations of these laws in the future. There is no assurance that we will be completely effective in ensuring our compliance with the FCPA or any other applicable anti-corruption laws. If we are not in compliance with the FCPA and other anti-corruption laws, we may be subject to criminal and civil penalties, disgorgement and other sanctions and remedial measures, and legal expenses, which could have an adverse impact on our business, financial condition, results of operations and liquidity. Likewise, any investigation of any potential violations of the FCPA or other anti-corruption laws or trade control laws by the United States could also have an adverse impact on our reputation, our business, results of operations and financial condition. \\n\\nRisks Related to Our Investments \\n\\nOur manufacturing operations in China and Europe require substantial investments, for which we cannot guarantee forecasted returns. \\n\\nIn 2020, we entered into an investment agreement and related factory leasing contract to design and develop manufacturing facilities in the Jiaxing Economic &#38; Technological Development Zone to manufacture plant-based meat products under the Beyond Meat brand in China and in the fourth quarter of 2021, we leased an approximately 12,000 square foot facility in Shanghai, which is used as a local research and development facility to support our local manufacturing operations. In the second quarter of 2020, we acquired our first manufacturing facility in Europe located in Enschede, the Netherlands. Our substantial investment in China and Europe may expose us to substantial risks and, as a result, we may not realize a return on our investment. Unforeseen delays in the operations of our Chinese or European manufacturing facilities may cause us to incur additional expenses. Operating these facilities may require additional capital expenditures and the efforts and attention of our management and other personnel, which will divert resources from our existing business or operations. Although our Chinese and European facilities are fully operational as of December 31, 2022, they may not provide us with all of the operational and financial benefits we expect to receive. These and other risks may result in our not realizing a return on, or losing some or all, of our planned investments in China and Europe, which could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and financial performance. \\n\\nOur ownership of real property is subject to all the risks inherent in an investment in real estate. \\n\\nWe have direct ownership of certain real estate properties. As is the case with any owner of real property, we are subject to potential liabilities, cost and damages arising out of owning, operating, leasing or otherwise having interests in real property. There are risks that a property may have unforeseen environmental or other hazards resulting in unexpected costs. In addition, we may not be able to expand or operate our owned facilities in the manner we desire, which could adversely impact our production and facility utilization. \\n\\nJoint ventures may not operate according to their business plans if our partners fail to fulfill their obligations, which may adversely affect our results of operations and compel us to dedicate additional resources to these joint ventures. \\n\\nThe nature of a joint venture requires us to share control in certain areas with unaffiliated third parties. If our joint venture partner does not fulfill its obligations, the affected joint venture may not be able to operate in \\n\\naccordance with its business plan. Under such a scenario, our results of operations may be adversely affected and we may be compelled to increase the level of our resources devoted to the joint venture. Also, differing views among joint venture participants may result in delayed decisions, or failure to agree on major issues. If such differences caused a joint venture to deviate from its business plan, our results of operations could be adversely affected. \\n\\nRisks Related to Our Intellectual Property, Information Technology, Cybersecurity and Privacy \\n\\nWe may not be able to protect our proprietary technology adequately, which may impact our commercial success. \\n\\nOur commercial success depends in part on our ability to protect our intellectual property and proprietary technologies. We rely on a combination of patent protection, where appropriate and available, copyrights, trade secrets and trademark laws, as well as confidentiality and other contractual restrictions to protect our proprietary technology. However, these legal means afford only limited protection and may not adequately protect our proprietary technology or permit us to gain or keep any competitive advantage. As of December 31, 2022, we had two issued patents in the United States and seven issued patents outside the United States (U.K., Indonesia, Canada, China, Chile, Israel and Australia), two pending patent applications in the United States, eight pending international patent applications and one provisional patent application. \\n\\nWe cannot offer any assurances about which, if any, patents will issue from these applications, the breadth of any such patents, or whether any issued patents will be found invalid and unenforceable or will be threatened by third parties. Any successful opposition to these patents or any other patents owned by or, if applicable in the future, licensed to us could deprive us of rights necessary for the successful commercialization of products that we may develop. Since patent applications in the United States and most other countries are confidential for a period of time after filing (in most cases 18 months after the filing of the priority application), we cannot be certain that we were the first to file on the technologies covered in several of the patent applications related to our technologies or products. Furthermore, a derivation proceeding can be provoked by a third party, or instituted by the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office, or USPTO, to determine who was the first to invent any of the subject matter covered by the patent claims of our applications. \\n\\nPatent law can be highly uncertain and involve complex legal and factual questions for which important principles remain unresolved. In the United States and in many international jurisdictions, policy regarding the breadth of claims allowed in patents can be inconsistent and/or unclear. The U.S. Supreme Court and the Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit have made, and will likely continue to make, changes in how the patent laws of the United States are interpreted. Similarly, international courts and governments have made, and will continue to make, changes in how the patent laws in their respective countries are interpreted. We cannot predict future changes in the interpretation of patent laws by U.S. and international judicial bodies or changes to patent laws that might be enacted into law by U.S. and international legislative bodies. \\n\\nWe may not be able to protect our intellectual property adequately, which may harm the value of our brand. \\n\\nWe believe that our intellectual property has substantial value and has contributed significantly to the success of our business. Our trademarks, including Beyond Meat, Beyond Burger, Beyond Beef, Beyond Sausage, Beyond Breakfast Sausage, Beyond Chicken, Beyond Steak, Beyond Fried Chicken, Beyond Popcorn Chicken, Beyond Meatballs, the Caped Steer Logo, Go Beyond, Eat What You Love, Cookout Classic and The Future of Protein, are valuable assets that reinforce our brand and consumers&#8217; favorable perception of our products. We also rely on unpatented proprietary expertise, recipes and formulations and other trade secrets and copyright protection to develop and maintain our competitive position. Our continued success depends, to a significant degree, upon our ability to protect and preserve our intellectual property, including our trademarks, trade dress, trade secrets and copyrights. We rely on confidentiality agreements and trademark, trade secret and copyright law to protect our intellectual property rights. \\n\\nOur confidentiality agreements with our employees and certain of our consultants, contract workers, suppliers and independent contractors, including some of our co-manufacturers who use our formulations to manufacture our products, generally require that all information made known to them be kept strictly confidential. Nevertheless, trade secrets are difficult to protect. Although we attempt to protect our trade secrets, our confidentiality agreements may not effectively prevent disclosure of our proprietary information and may not provide an adequate remedy in the event of unauthorized disclosure of such information. If we do not keep our trade secrets confidential, others may produce products with our recipes or formulations. In addition, others may independently discover our trade secrets, in which case we would not be able to assert trade secret rights against such parties. Further, some of our formulations have been developed by or with our suppliers and co-manufacturers. As a result, we may not be able to prevent others from using similar formulations. As we begin to expand globally as part of our long-term growth strategy, we may face additional risks protecting our trade secrets internationally, where the laws may not be as protective of intellectual property rights as those in the United States. \\n\\nWe cannot assure you that the steps we have taken to protect our intellectual property rights are adequate, that our intellectual property rights can be successfully defended and asserted in the future or that third parties will not infringe upon or misappropriate any such rights. In addition, our trademark rights and related registrations may be challenged in the future and could be canceled or narrowed. Failure to protect our trademark rights could prevent us in the future from challenging third parties who use names and logos similar to our trademarks, which may in turn cause consumer confusion or negatively affect consumers&#8217; perception of our brand and products. Moreover, intellectual property disputes and proceedings and infringement claims may result in a significant distraction for management and significant expense, which may not be recoverable regardless of whether we are successful. Such proceedings may be protracted with no certainty of success, and an adverse outcome could subject us to liabilities, force us to cease use of certain trademarks or other intellectual property or force us to enter into licenses with others. Any one of these occurrences may have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition. \\n\\nAdditionally, the laws of certain international jurisdictions in which our products may be sold may not protect intellectual property rights to the same extent as the laws of the United States. As a result, we may not be able to effectively prevent third parties from infringing or otherwise misappropriating our trademark rights in such jurisdictions. Moreover, failure to obtain adequate trademark rights in these foreign jurisdictions could negatively impact our ability to expand our business and launch products in certain international markets. Further, we may not be able to effectively protect our intellectual property rights against unauthorized third parties that obtain the rights to our trademarks in foreign jurisdictions where we have not yet applied for trademark protections, and we may expend substantial cost to obtain those trademarks from such third parties. Any one of these occurrences could reduce our competitive position or otherwise have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition. \\n\\nWe rely on information technology systems and any inadequacy, failure, interruption or security breaches of those systems may harm our ability to effectively operate our business. \\n\\nWe are dependent on various information technology systems, including, but not limited to, networks, applications and outsourced services in connection with the operation of our business. A failure of our information technology systems to perform as we anticipate could disrupt our business and result in transaction errors, processing inefficiencies and loss of sales, causing our business to suffer. In addition, our information technology systems may be vulnerable to damage or interruption from circumstances beyond our control, including fire, severe weather, natural disasters, systems failures, viruses and security breaches, particularly in light of many of our employees working remotely. Any such damage or interruption could have a material adverse effect on our business. \\n\\nA cybersecurity incident, other technology disruptions or failure to comply with laws and regulations relating to privacy and the protection of data relating to individuals could negatively impact our business, our reputation and our relationships with customers. \\n\\nWe use computers in substantially all aspects of our business operations. We also use mobile devices, social networking and other online activities to connect with our employees, suppliers, co-manufacturers, distributors, customers and consumers. Such uses give rise to cybersecurity risks, including security breaches, espionage, system disruption, theft and inadvertent release of information. Our business involves the storage and transmission of numerous classes of sensitive and/or confidential information and intellectual property, including customers&#8217; and suppliers&#8217; information, private information about employees and financial and strategic information about us and our business partners. Further, as we pursue new initiatives that improve our operations and cost structure, potentially including acquisitions, we may also expand and improve our information technologies, resulting in a larger technological presence and corresponding exposure to cybersecurity risk. If we fail to assess and identify cybersecurity risks associated with new initiatives or acquisitions, we may become increasingly vulnerable to such risks. Additionally, while we have implemented measures to prevent security breaches and cyber incidents, our preventative measures and incident response efforts may not be entirely effective. The theft, destruction, loss, misappropriation, or release of sensitive and/or confidential information or intellectual property, or interference with our information technology systems or the technology systems of third parties on which we rely, could result in business disruption, negative publicity, brand damage, violation of privacy laws, loss of customers, potential liability and competitive disadvantage all of which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition or results of operations. \\n\\nIn addition, we are subject to laws, rules and regulations in the United States, the European Union, China and other jurisdictions relating to the collection, use and security of personal information and data. Such data privacy laws, regulations and other obligations may require us to change our business practices and may negatively impact our ability to expand our business and pursue business opportunities. We may incur significant expenses to comply with the laws, regulations and other obligations that apply to us. Additionally, the privacy and data protection-related laws, rules and regulations applicable to us are subject to significant change. Several jurisdictions have passed new laws and regulations in this area, and other jurisdictions are considering imposing additional restrictions. For example, our operations are subject to the European Union&#8217;s General Data Protection Regulation, which imposes data privacy and security requirements on companies doing business in the European Union, including substantial penalties for non-compliance. The California Consumer Privacy Act (the &#8220;CCPA&#8221;), which went into effect on January 1, 2020, imposes similar requirements on companies handling data of California residents and creates a new and potentially severe statutory damages framework for (i) violations of the CCPA and (ii) businesses that fail to implement reasonable security procedures and practices to prevent data breaches. The California Privacy Rights Act, which became effective January 1, 2023, amends and expands the CCPA, including by expanding consumer&#8217;s rights in their personal information and creating a new governmental agency to interpret and enforce the statute. Additionally, in August 2021, the National People&#8217;s Congress of the People's Republic of China adopted the Personal Information Protection Law, which became effective on November 1, 2021 and provides a comprehensive system for the protection of personal information in China. Privacy and data protection-related laws and regulations also may be interpreted and enforced inconsistently over time and from jurisdiction to jurisdiction. Any actual or perceived inability to comply with applicable privacy or data protection laws, regulations, or other obligations could result in significant cost and liability, litigation or governmental investigations, damage our reputation, and adversely affect our business. \\n\\nRisks Related to Our Lease Obligations, Indebtedness, Financial Position and Need for Additional Capital \\n\\nIf the build out of our new Campus Headquarters is delayed or incurs cost overruns, the headquarters does not operate in accordance with our expectations or occupancy rates are lower than anticipated, our business or financial condition or results of operations may be adversely affected. \\n\\nOn January 14, 2021, we entered into a lease agreement for an initial term of 12 years to develop and house our new Campus Headquarters. The space is being built out by the landlord, who delivered Phase 1-A of the space, which we currently occupy, to us in the third quarter of 2022. We expect the landlord to deliver to us the remainder of the space by the end of 2023; however, there can be no assurances that the remainder of the space will be ready for occupancy on or before the expected occupancy date due to force majeure events (such as COVID-19) or the risk of delays or cost overruns inherent in construction development projects, any of which could have a negative impact on our financial condition or results of operations. If we are not able to complete development of the Campus Headquarters within the approved budget or there are significant cost overruns, our cash flows, financial condition, or results of operations could be materially and adversely affected. \\n\\nIn addition, it is possible that, once finalized, there could be unanticipated difficulties in initiating operations at the Campus Headquarters, including, but not limited to, IT system interruptions, other infrastructure support problems or the space may prove to be less conducive to our operations than currently anticipated. These risks could all result in operational inefficiencies or similar difficulties that could prove difficult or impossible to remediate and have an adverse impact on our financial condition or results of operations. Moreover, we are uncertain about how the long-term impacts of COVID-19 (for example, a shift in the percentage of our workforce that works remotely) will affect our ability to timely fully occupy the Campus Headquarters once construction is complete, which could have a negative impact on our financial condition or results of operations. \\n\\nIf we are unable to occupy the Campus Headquarters space, we may have to sublease the unoccupied portion of the Campus Headquarters. A sublease agreement would be subject to certain risks and uncertainties, such as the possibility that such agreement may not be completed on terms that are advantageous to us as we may not receive sufficiently high rental rates to cover our lease obligations which could have a negative impact on our financial condition and results of operations. \\n\\nWe currently have, and will continue to have, significant lease obligations, and our failure to meet those obligations could adversely affect our financial condition and business. \\n\\nWe currently have, and will continue to have, significant lease obligations for our corporate offices, manufacturing facilities, research and development facilities and warehouses. We depend on cash flow from operations to pay our lease expenses. \\n\\nIf our business does not generate sufficient cash flow from operating activities to fund these expenses, we may not be able to meet our lease obligations, which could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and business. Furthermore, the significant cash flow required to satisfy our financial obligations under the leases could limit our ability to incur indebtedness and make capital expenditures or other investments in our business. \\n\\nOur significant indebtedness and liabilities could limit the cash flow available for our operations, expose us to risks that could adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations and impair our ability to satisfy our obligations under our Notes. \\n\\nAs of December 31, 2022, we had approximately $1.3 billion of consolidated indebtedness and other liabilities. We may also incur additional indebtedness to meet future financing needs. Our indebtedness could have significant negative consequences for our security holders and our business, results of operations and financial condition by, among other things: \\n\\n&#8226; increasing our vulnerability to adverse economic and industry conditions; \\n\\n&#8226; limiting our ability to obtain additional financing; \\n\\n&#8226; requiring the dedication of a substantial portion of our cash flow from operations to service our indebtedness, which will reduce the amount of cash available for other purposes; \\n\\n&#8226; limiting our flexibility to plan for, or react to, changes in our business; \\n\\n&#8226; diluting the interests of our existing stockholders as a result of issuing shares of our common stock upon conversion of the Notes; and \\n\\n&#8226; placing us at a possible competitive disadvantage with competitors that are less leveraged than us or have better access to capital. \\n\\nIn March 2021, we issued $1.0 billion aggregate principal amount of our 0% Convertible Senior Notes due 2027 (the &#8220;Convertible Notes&#8221;) in a private placement to qualified institutional buyers pursuant to Rule 144A under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended (the &#8220;Securities Act&#8221;). The initial purchasers of the Convertible Notes also exercised their option to purchase an additional $150.0 million aggregate principal amount of our 0% Convertible Senior Notes due 2027 (the &#8220;Additional Notes,&#8221; and together with the Convertible Notes, the &#8220;Notes&#8221;), and such Additional Notes were issued on March 16, 2021. \\n\\nOur ability to make scheduled payments of the principal of, to pay interest on or to refinance our current or future indebtedness, including the Notes, as applicable, depends on our future performance, which is subject to economic, financial, competitive and other factors beyond our control. Our business may not generate sufficient funds, and we may otherwise be unable to maintain sufficient cash reserves, to pay amounts due under our current or future indebtedness, including the Notes, and our cash needs may increase in the future. In addition, any future indebtedness that we may incur may contain financial and other restrictive covenants that limit our ability to operate our business, raise capital or make payments under our other indebtedness. If we fail to comply with these covenants or to make payments under our indebtedness when due, then we would be in default under that indebtedness, which could, in turn, result in that and our other indebtedness becoming immediately payable in full. \\n\\nWe may be unable to raise the funds necessary to repurchase the Notes for cash following a fundamental change, or to pay the cash amounts due upon conversion, and our future indebtedness may limit our ability to repurchase the Notes or pay cash upon their conversion. \\n\\nHolders of the Notes may, subject to a limited exception, require us to repurchase their Notes following a &#8220;Fundamental Change&#8221; (as defined in the Indenture) at a cash repurchase price generally equal to the principal amount of the Notes to be repurchased, plus accrued and unpaid special and additional interest, if any. In addition, all conversions of Notes will be settled partially or entirely in cash. We may not have enough available cash or be able to obtain financing at the time we are required to repurchase the Notes or pay the cash amounts due upon conversion. In addition, applicable law, regulatory authorities and the agreements governing our future indebtedness may restrict our ability to repurchase the Notes or pay the cash amounts due upon conversion. Our failure to repurchase the Notes or to pay the cash amounts due upon conversion when required will constitute a default under the Indenture. A default under the Indenture or the Fundamental Change itself could also lead to a default under agreements governing our future indebtedness, which may result in that indebtedness becoming immediately payable in full. If the repayment of such future indebtedness were to be accelerated after any applicable notice or grace periods, then we may not have sufficient funds to repay that indebtedness and repurchase the Notes or make cash payments upon their conversion. \\n\\nThe accounting method for the Notes could adversely affect our reported financial condition and results. \\n\\nOur Notes do not bear regular interest, and the principal amount of the Notes do not accrete. However, special interest and additional interest may accrue on the Notes at a rate per annum not exceeding 0.50% (subject to certain exceptions) upon the occurrence of certain events relating to the failure to file certain SEC reports or to remove certain restrictive legends from the Notes. The accounting method for reflecting the Notes \\n\\non our balance sheet may adversely affect our reported earnings and financial condition. If any of the conditions to the convertibility of the Notes is satisfied or the Notes become due within one year, then we may be required under applicable accounting standards to reclassify the liability carrying value of the Notes as a current, rather than a long-term, liability. This reclassification could be required even if no noteholders convert their Notes and could materially reduce our reported working capital. \\n\\nWe early adopted Accounting Standards Update (&#8220;ASU&#8221;) No. 2020-06, &#8220;Debt with Conversion and Other Options (Subtopic 470-20) and Derivatives and Hedging&#8212;Contracts in Entity's Own Equity&#8221; (&#8220;ASU 2020-06&#8221;), to account for our Notes which eliminates the treasury stock method for convertible instruments that can be settled in whole or in part with equity and instead requires the application of the more dilutive of the &#8220;if-converted&#8221; method or the two-class method. Under the if-converted method, diluted earnings per share would generally be calculated assuming that all the conversion premium or spread were converted at the beginning of the reporting period, unless the result would be anti-dilutive. The conversion premium or spread would have a dilutive impact on net income per share when the average market price of the Company&#8217;s common stock for a given period exceeds the conversion price. \\n\\nThe capped call transactions may affect the value of the Notes and our common stock. \\n\\nIn connection with the Notes, we entered into privately negotiated capped call transactions with the option counterparties. The capped call transactions will cover, subject to customary adjustments, the number of shares of common stock that underlie the Notes. The capped call transactions are expected generally to reduce potential dilution to our common stock upon conversion of the Notes or at our election (subject to certain conditions) offset any cash payments we are required to make in excess of the aggregate principal amount of the converted Notes, as the case may be, with such reduction or offset subject to a cap. \\n\\nWe have been advised that, in connection with establishing their initial hedges of the capped call transactions, the option counterparties or their respective affiliates purchased shares of our common stock and/or entered into various derivative transactions with respect to our common stock. \\n\\nIn addition, we have been advised that the option counterparties or their respective affiliates may modify their hedge positions by entering into or unwinding various derivatives with respect to our common stock and/or purchasing or selling our common stock or other securities of ours in secondary market transactions following the pricing of the Notes and prior to the maturity of the Notes (and are likely to do so on each exercise date of the capped call transactions, and in connection with any early termination event in respect of the capped call transactions). This activity could also cause or avoid an increase or a decrease in the market price of our common stock. \\n\\nProvisions in the indenture governing the Notes could delay or prevent an otherwise beneficial takeover of us. \\n\\nCertain provisions in the Notes and the indenture governing the Notes could make a third party attempt to acquire us more difficult or expensive. For example, if a takeover constitutes a fundamental change, then noteholders will have the right to require us to repurchase their Notes for cash. In addition, if a takeover constitutes a Make-Whole Fundamental Change (as defined in the Indenture), then we may be required to temporarily increase the conversion rate. In either case, and in other cases, our obligations under the Notes and the indenture governing the Notes could increase the cost of acquiring us or otherwise discourage a third party from acquiring us or removing incumbent management, including in a transaction that holders of our common stock or Notes may view as favorable. \\n\\nWe may require additional financing to achieve our goals, and a failure to obtain this necessary capital when needed on acceptable terms, or at all, may force us to delay, limit, reduce or terminate our product manufacturing and development, and other operations. \\n\\nSince our inception, substantially all of our resources have been dedicated to the development of our three core plant-based product platforms of beef, pork and poultry, including purchases of property, plant and \\n\\nequipment, principally to support the development and production of our products, the build-out and equipping of our former Manhattan Beach Project Innovation Center and our Innovation Center within our Campus Headquarters, and the purchase, build-out and equipping of manufacturing facilities in the U.S. and abroad. We have and believe that we will continue to expend resources as we expand into additional markets we may choose to pursue. These expenditures are expected to include costs associated with research and development, manufacturing and supply, as well as marketing and selling existing and new products. In addition, other unanticipated costs may arise. \\n\\nAs of December 31, 2022, we had cash and cash equivalents and restricted cash of $322.5 million. Our operating plan may change because of factors currently unknown to us, and we may need to seek additional funds sooner than planned, through public or private equity or debt financings or other sources, including strategic collaborations. Such financing may result in dilution to stockholders, reduction in the market price of our common stock, imposition of debt covenants and repayment obligations, or other restrictions that may adversely affect our business. In addition, we may seek additional capital due to favorable market conditions or strategic considerations even if we believe we have sufficient funds for our current or future operating plans. However, the capital markets may experience extreme volatility and disruption, including rising interest rates and higher borrowing costs, which could make it more difficult for us to raise capital. If we cannot access the capital markets upon favorable terms or at all, it may impact our ability to achieve our goals. \\n\\nOur future capital requirements depend on many factors, including: \\n\\n&#8226; the number and characteristics of any additional products or manufacturing processes we develop or acquire to serve new or existing markets; \\n\\n&#8226; our investment in and build out of our Campus Headquarters; \\n\\n&#8226; the expenses associated with our marketing initiatives; \\n\\n&#8226; our investment in manufacturing and facilities to expand our manufacturing and production capacity; \\n\\n&#8226; our investments in real property and joint ventures; \\n\\n&#8226; the costs required to fund domestic and international operations and growth; \\n\\n&#8226; the scope, progress, results and costs of researching and developing future products or improvements to existing products or manufacturing processes; \\n\\n&#8226; any lawsuits related to our products or commenced against us or our directors and officers; \\n\\n&#8226; the expenses needed to attract and retain skilled personnel; \\n\\n&#8226; the costs associated with being a public company; \\n\\n&#8226; the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic, or any other pandemic, epidemic or other public health crisis; \\n\\n&#8226; the costs involved in preparing, filing, prosecuting, maintaining, defending and enforcing intellectual property claims, including litigation costs and the outcome of such litigation; and \\n\\n&#8226; the timing, receipt and amount of sales of, or royalties on, any future approved products, if any. \\n\\nAdditional funds may not be available when we need them, on terms that are acceptable to us, or at all. If adequate funds are not available to us on a timely basis, we may be required to: \\n\\n&#8226; delay, limit, reduce or terminate our manufacturing, research and development activities or our growth and expansion plans; or \\n\\n&#8226; delay, limit, reduce or terminate our establishment of sales and marketing capabilities or other activities that may be necessary to generate revenue and achieve profitability. \\n\\nOur inability to access and employ the cash that collateralizes our outstanding and future letters of credit may impact our liquidity. \\n\\nAs of December 31, 2022, we had restricted cash of $12.6 million securing the letter of credit to support the development and leasing of our Campus Headquarters. Our inability to access and employ the cash that collateralizes our outstanding and future letters of credit may impact our liquidity and could have an adverse impact on our business, operations and financial condition. \\n\\nRisks Related to the Environment, Climate and Weather \\n\\nA major earthquake, tsunami, tornado, wildfire, flood, drought or other natural disaster or severe weather event could seriously disrupt our entire business. \\n\\nWe have offices, co-manufacturing and manufacturing facilities located in the United States and internationally. The impact of a major earthquake, tsunami, tornado, flood, wildfire, drought or other natural disaster or severe weather event at any of our facilities and overall operations is difficult to predict, but such a natural disaster or severe weather event could seriously disrupt our entire business and lead to substantial losses, which may not be covered by insurance. Additionally, to the extent such events become more frequent or intense, such as a result of climate change, it may adversely impact the cost or availability of such insurance. \\n\\nClimate change may negatively affect our business and operations. \\n\\nIncreasing concentrations of greenhouse gases in the atmosphere have generally been concluded to lead to increased ambient global temperatures, as well as changes in weather patterns and the frequency and severity of extreme weather and natural disasters. Adverse climate conditions, weather patterns and the impact of such conditions and patterns such as drought, flood, wildfires, mudslides and rising ambient temperatures adversely impact product cultivation conditions for farmers and agricultural productivity, including by disrupting ecosystems and severely altering the growing conditions, nutrient levels, soil moisture and water availability necessary for the growth and cultivation of crops, which would adversely affect the product quality, availability or cost of certain commodities that are necessary for our products, such as yellow peas, mung beans, sunflowers, rice, faba bean, canola oil and coconut oil. Many of our operations exist in water-stressed regions and water is a key ingredient in our products. Due to climate change, we may also be subjected to decreased availability of water, deteriorated quality of water or less favorable pricing for water, which could adversely impact our manufacturing and distribution operations. These and other changes to the physical environment may adversely impact our operations or those of the suppliers on whom we rely. While we may take various actions to mitigate our business risks associated with climate change, this may require us to incur substantial costs and may not be successful, due to, among other things, the uncertainty associated with the longer-term projections associated with managing climate risks. \\n\\nRisks Related to Being a Public Company \\n\\nIf we fail to maintain proper and effective internal controls, our ability to produce accurate financial statements on a timely basis could be impaired, investors may lose confidence in our financial reporting and the trading price of our common stock may decline. \\n\\nEnsuring that we have adequate internal financial and accounting controls and procedures in place to produce accurate financial statements on a timely basis is a costly and time-consuming effort that needs to be re-evaluated frequently. We are in the process of upgrading our information technology systems and implementing additional financial and management controls, reporting systems and procedures in order to keep up with the requirements of being a reporting company under the Exchange Act. Additionally, the growth of our operations and our being a public company have created a need for additional resources within the accounting and finance functions due to the increasing need to produce timely financial information and to ensure the level of segregation of duties customary for a U.S. public company. We have hired additional resources in the accounting and finance functions and continue to reassess the sufficiency of finance personnel in response to these increasing demands and expectations. \\n\\nAs a public company, we are required to document and test our internal control over financial reporting pursuant to Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act so that our management can certify as to the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting. The rules governing the standards that must be met for management to assess our internal control over financial reporting are complex and require significant documentation, testing and possible remediation. We have and will continue to expend significant resources in developing the necessary documentation and testing procedures required by Section 404. We cannot be certain that the actions we have and will continue to take to improve our internal controls over financial reporting will be sufficient. \\n\\nAny failure to maintain internal control over financial reporting could severely inhibit our ability to accurately report our financial condition, results of operations or cash flows. If we are unable to conclude that our internal control over financial reporting is effective, or if our independent registered public accounting firm determines we have a material weakness or significant deficiency in our internal control over financial reporting, investors may lose confidence in the accuracy and completeness of our financial reports, the market price of our common stock could decline, and we could be subject to sanctions or investigations by NASDAQ, the SEC or other regulatory authorities. Failure to remedy any material weakness in our internal control over financial reporting, or to implement or maintain other effective control systems required of public companies, could also restrict our future access to the capital markets. \\n\\nOur disclosure controls and procedures may not prevent or detect all errors or acts of fraud. \\n\\nOur disclosure controls and procedures are designed to reasonably assure that information required to be disclosed by us in reports we file or submit under the Exchange Act is accumulated and communicated to management, recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time periods specified in the rules and forms of the SEC. We believe that any disclosure controls and procedures or internal controls and procedures, no matter how well conceived and operated, can provide only reasonable, not absolute, assurance that the objectives of the control system are met. \\n\\nThese inherent limitations include the realities that judgments in decision-making can be faulty, and that breakdowns can occur because of simple error or mistake. Additionally, controls can be circumvented by the individual acts of some persons, by collusion of two or more people or by an unauthorized override of the controls. Accordingly, because of the inherent limitations in our control system, misstatements or insufficient disclosures due to error or fraud may occur and not be detected. \\n\\nThe requirements of being a public company will require us to incur increased costs and may strain our resources, divert management&#8217;s attention and affect our ability to attract and retain qualified board members. \\n\\nAs a public company, we have incurred and will continue to incur significant legal, accounting and other expenses that we did not incur as a private company. We are subject to the reporting requirements of the Exchange Act which requires, among other things, that we file with the SEC annual, quarterly and current reports with respect to our business and financial condition. In addition, the Sarbanes-Oxley Act, as well as related rules adopted by the SEC and the Nasdaq Global Select Market, impose significant requirements on public companies, including requiring establishment and maintenance of effective disclosure and financial controls and changes in corporate governance practices. Further, we are required to comply with certain requirements of the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act, or the Dodd-Frank Act, as well as rules and regulations subsequently implemented by the SEC related to corporate governance and executive compensation, such as &#8220;say on pay&#8221; and proxy access. As such, we have and will continue to incur additional compliance-related expenses. Additionally, the SEC and other regulators have continued to adopt new rules and regulations and make additional changes to existing regulations that require our compliance. \\n\\nStockholder activism, the current political environment and the current high level of government intervention and regulatory reform may lead to substantial new regulations and disclosure obligations, which may lead to additional compliance costs and impact, in ways we cannot currently anticipate, the manner in which we operate our business. We expect the rules and regulations applicable to public companies to continue to increase our \\n\\nlegal and financial compliance costs and to make some activities more time-consuming and costly. If these requirements divert the attention of our management and personnel from other business concerns, they could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. The increased costs will decrease our net income or increase our net loss and may require us to reduce costs in other areas of our business. Furthermore, these rules and regulations could make it more difficult or more costly for us to obtain certain types of insurance, including director and officer liability insurance, and we may be forced to accept reduced policy limits and coverage and higher self-insured retention amounts, or incur substantially higher costs to obtain the same or similar coverage. The impact of these requirements could also make it more difficult for us to attract and retain qualified persons to serve on our board of directors, our board committees or as executive officers. We cannot predict or estimate the amount or timing of additional costs we may incur to respond to these requirements. \\n\\nRisks Related to Regulatory and Legal Compliance Matters, Litigation and Legal Proceedings \\n\\nOur operations are subject to FDA governmental regulation and other foreign, federal, state and local regulation, and there is no assurance that we will be in compliance with all regulations. \\n\\nOur operations are subject to extensive regulation by the FDA, and other foreign, federal, state and local authorities. Specifically, for products manufactured or sold in the United States we are subject to the requirements of the Federal Food, Drug and Cosmetic Act and regulations promulgated thereunder by the FDA. \\n\\nThis comprehensive regulatory program governs, among other things, the manufacturing, composition and ingredients, packaging, labeling and safety of food. Under this program, the FDA requires that facilities that manufacture food products comply with a range of requirements, including hazard analysis and preventive controls regulations, current good manufacturing practices (&#8220;cGMPs&#8221;), and supplier verification requirements. Comparable regulations apply in foreign jurisdictions such as the European Union, the United Kingdom and China. Our processing and manufacturing facilities, including those of our co-manufacturers, are subject to periodic inspection by foreign, federal, state and local authorities. We do not control the manufacturing processes of, and rely upon, our co-manufacturers for compliance with cGMPs for the manufacturing of our products by our co-manufacturers. If we or our co-manufacturers cannot successfully manufacture products that conform to our specifications and the strict regulatory requirements of the FDA or other non-U.S. regulators, we or they may be subject to adverse inspectional findings or enforcement actions, which could materially impact our ability to market our products, could result in our inability to manufacture our products or our co-manufacturers&#8217; inability to continue manufacturing for us, or could result in a recall of our product that has already been distributed. In addition, we rely upon our co-manufacturers to maintain adequate quality control, quality assurance and qualified personnel. If the FDA or a comparable state, local or foreign regulatory authority determines that we or these co-manufacturers have not complied with the applicable regulatory requirements, our business may be materially impacted. \\n\\nWe seek to comply with applicable regulations through a combination of employing internal experience and expert personnel to ensure quality-assurance compliance (i.e., assuring that our products are not adulterated or misbranded) and contracting with third-party laboratories that conduct analyses of products to ensure compliance with nutrition labeling requirements and to identify any potential contaminants before distribution. Failure by us or our co-manufacturers to comply with applicable laws and regulations or maintain permits, licenses or registrations relating to our or our co-manufacturers&#8217; operations could subject us to civil remedies or penalties, including fines, injunctions, recalls or seizures, warning letters, restrictions or prohibitions on the marketing or manufacturing of products, or refusals to permit the import or export of products, as well as potential criminal sanctions, which could result in increased operating costs resulting in a material effect on our operating results and business. \\n\\nWe are subject to international regulations that could adversely affect our business and results of operations. \\n\\nWe are subject to extensive regulations internationally where we manufacture, distribute and/or sell our products. Our products are subject to numerous food safety and other laws and regulations relating to the \\n\\nsourcing, manufacturing, composition and ingredients, storing, labeling, marketing, advertising and distribution of these products. For example, in early 2018, we received an inquiry from Canadian officials about the labeling and composition of products that we export to Canada. We responded promptly to that inquiry, identifying minor formulation changes that we made under Canadian regulations. If regulators determine that the labeling, advertising and/or composition of any of our products is not in compliance with foreign law or regulations, or if we or our co-manufacturers otherwise fail to comply with applicable laws and regulations in foreign jurisdictions where we operate and market products, we could be subject to civil remedies or penalties, such as fines, injunctions, recalls or seizures, warning letters, restrictions on the marketing or manufacturing of the products, or refusals to permit the import or export of products, as well as potential criminal sanctions. In places like Mainland China, government inquiries into product labeling and advertising can be prompted by random inspections of our product on the market by local government authorities or complaints by consumers or competitors to the authorities. The consequences of a labeling or advertising violation in China can lead not only to fines from administrative authorities but also to multiple individual consumer lawsuits for nominal damages in the hundreds of dollars each, which can be costly to defend. In addition, enforcement of existing laws and regulations, changes in legal requirements and/or evolving interpretations of existing regulatory requirements may result in increased compliance costs and create other obligations, financial or otherwise, that could adversely affect our business, financial condition or operating results. For example, China has recently introduced new regulations on food manufacturing and it may introduce new Food Labeling Supervision Measures that could increase restrictions and require changes to our labels. In addition, with our expanding international operations, we could be adversely affected by violations of the FCPA, and similar worldwide anti-bribery laws, which generally prohibit companies and their intermediaries from making improper payments to non-U.S. officials or other third parties for the purpose of obtaining or retaining business. While our policies mandate compliance with these anti-bribery laws, our internal control policies and procedures may not protect us from reckless or criminal acts committed by our employees, contractors or agents. Violations of these laws, or allegations of such violations, could disrupt our business and result in a material adverse effect on our results of operations, cash flows and financial condition. \\n\\nAny changes in, or changes in the interpretation of, applicable laws, regulations or policies of the FDA or U.S. Department of Agriculture, or USDA, state regulators or similar foreign regulatory authorities that relate to the use of the word &#8220;meat&#8221; or other similar words in connection with plant-based meat products could adversely affect our business, prospects, results of operations or financial condition. \\n\\nThe FDA and the USDA, state regulators or similar foreign regulatory authorities, such as Health Canada or the CFIA, or authorities of the U.K., the EU or the EU member states, or China, including the State Administration for Market Regulation and its local counterpart agencies, could take action to impact our ability to use the term &#8220;meat&#8221; or similar words (such as &#8220;beef,&#8221; &#8220;burger&#8221; or &#8220;sausage,&#8221; including the Beyond Meat logo of the Caped Longhorn superhero) to describe or advertise our products. In addition, a food may be deemed misbranded if its labeling is false or misleading in any particular way, and the FDA, CFIA, EU member state authorities or other regulators could interpret the use of the term &#8220;meat&#8221; or any similar phrase(s) to describe our plant-based meat products as false or misleading or likely to create an erroneous impression regarding their composition. \\n\\nFor example, in 2018, the state of Missouri passed a law prohibiting any person engaged in advertising, offering for sale, or sale of food products from misrepresenting a product as meat that is not derived from harvested production livestock or poultry. The state of Missouri Department of Agriculture has clarified its interpretation that products which include prominent disclosure that the product is &#8220;made from plants,&#8221; or comparable disclosure such as through the use of the phrase &#8220;plant-based,&#8221; are not misrepresented under the Missouri law. Additional states, including Arkansas, Georgia, Mississippi, Louisiana, Oklahoma, South Dakota and Wyoming, have subsequently passed similar laws, and legislation that would impose specific requirements on the naming of plant-based meat products is currently pending in a number of other states. The United States Congress recently considered (but did not pass) federal legislation, called the Real MEAT Act, that could require changes to our product labeling and marketing, including identifying products as &#8220;imitation&#8221; meat products, and that would give USDA certain oversight over the labeling of plant-based meat products. If similar bills gain traction and ultimately become law, we could be required to identify our products as &#8220;imitation&#8221; in our product \\n\\nlabels. Further, the FDA has announced that it is developing guidance on naming plant-based meat alternatives that could impact our naming expectations. Canadian Food and Drug Regulations also provide requirements for &#8220;simulated meat&#8221; products, including requirements around composition and naming. \\n\\nIn Europe, the Agriculture Committee of the European Parliament proposed in May 2019 to reserve the use of &#8220;meat&#8221; and meat-related terms and names for products that are manufactured from the edible parts of animals. In October 2020, the European Parliament rejected the adoption of this provision. In the absence of European Union legislation, Member States remain free to establish national restrictions on meat-related names. In June 2020, France adopted a law prohibiting names to indicate foodstuffs of animal origin to describe, market, or promote foodstuffs containing vegetable proteins. In October 2021, France published a draft implementing decree to define, for example, the sanctions in case of non-compliance with the new law. The Decree was published on June 29, 2022, and entered into force on October 1, 2022. We do not believe that the Decree complies with the laws of the European Union (EU), in particular the principle of free movement of goods. On July 27, 2022, at the request of a trade association, the French High Administrative Court partially suspended the execution of the Decree. This signals that there are indeed serious doubts as to the lawfulness of the Decree, though the suspension is only partial and temporary until the Court rules on the merits of the case. We understand that at least two more trade associations are also considering litigation. In this context, on October 21, 2022, the Company filed an application for annulment against the Decree. The Company also intervened in favor of the trade association in their pending case against the Decree on November 16, 2022. \\n\\nFrance is the first EU Member State to adopt such a law. Should other EU Member State regulatory authorities take action with respect to the use of the term &#8220;meat&#8221; or similar claims, such that we are unable to use those terms with respect to our plant-based products, we could be subject to enforcement action or recall of our products marketed with these terms, we may be required to modify our marketing strategy, or required to identify our products as &#8220;imitation&#8221; in our product labels, and our business, prospects, results of operations or financial condition could be adversely affected. \\n\\nIncreases in income tax rates or changes in income tax laws could have a material adverse impact on our financial results. \\n\\nIncreases in income tax rates or other changes in tax laws, including changes in how existing tax laws are interpreted or enforced, could adversely affect our financial performance. The increasingly complex global tax environment has in the past and could continue to increase tax uncertainty, resulting in higher compliance costs and adverse effects on our financial performance. We are also subject to regular reviews, examinations and audits by numerous taxing authorities with respect to income and non-income based taxes. Economic and political pressures to increase tax revenues in jurisdictions in which we operate, or the adoption of new or reformed tax legislation or regulation, may make resolving tax disputes more difficult and the final resolution of tax audits and any related litigation can differ from our historical provisions and accruals, resulting in an adverse effect on our financial performance. \\n\\nLitigation or legal proceedings could expose us to significant liabilities and have a negative impact on our reputation or business. \\n\\nFrom time to time, we may be party to various claims and litigation proceedings. We evaluate these claims and litigation proceedings to assess the likelihood of unfavorable outcomes and to estimate, if possible, the amount of potential losses. Based on these assessments and estimates, we may establish reserves, as appropriate. These assessments and estimates are based on the information available to management at the time and involve a significant amount of management judgment. Actual outcomes or losses may differ materially from our assessments and estimates. For information regarding pending legal proceedings, please see Part I, Item 3 , Legal Proceedings, and Note 1 0 , Commitments and Contingencies , to the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included elsewhere in this report. \\n\\nEven when not merited, the defense of these lawsuits may divert our management&#8217;s attention, and we may incur significant expenses in defending these lawsuits. The results of litigation and other legal proceedings are inherently uncertain, and adverse judgments or settlements in some of these legal disputes may result in \\n\\nadverse monetary damages, penalties or injunctive relief against us, which could have a material adverse effect on our financial position, cash flows or results of operations. Any claims or litigation, even if fully indemnified or insured, could damage our reputation and make it more difficult to compete effectively or to obtain adequate insurance in the future. \\n\\nFurthermore, while we maintain insurance for certain potential liabilities, such insurance does not cover all types and amounts of potential liabilities and is subject to self-insured retentions, various exclusions as well as caps on amounts recoverable. Even if we believe a claim is covered by insurance, insurers may dispute our entitlement to recovery for a variety of potential reasons, which may affect the timing and, if the insurers prevail, the amount of our recovery. \\n\\nGeneral Risk Factors \\n\\nOur share price has been and may continue to be highly volatile, and you could lose all or part of your investment. \\n\\nThe market price of our common stock has been and is likely to continue to be highly volatile and could be subject to wide fluctuations in response to many factors discussed in this &#8220; Risk Factors &#8221; section, including: \\n\\n&#8226; general economic, market and political conditions, including negative effects on consumer confidence and spending levels; \\n\\n&#8226; actual or anticipated fluctuations in our financial condition and operating results, including fluctuations in our quarterly and annual results; \\n\\n&#8226; announcements of innovations by us or our competitors; \\n\\n&#8226; announcement by competitors or new market entrants of their entry into or exit from the plant-based meat market; \\n\\n&#8226; overall conditions in our industry and the markets in which we operate; \\n\\n&#8226; market conditions or trends in the packaged food sales industry or in the economy as a whole; \\n\\n&#8226; addition or loss of significant customers or other developments with respect to significant customers; \\n\\n&#8226; adverse developments concerning our manufacturers or suppliers; \\n\\n&#8226; changes in laws or regulations applicable to our products or business; \\n\\n&#8226; our ability to effectively manage our growth and market expectations with respect to our growth; \\n\\n&#8226; speculation regarding public customer announcements or geographic expansion; \\n\\n&#8226; actual or anticipated changes in our growth rate relative to our competitors; \\n\\n&#8226; announcements by us or our competitors of significant acquisitions, strategic partnerships, joint ventures or capital commitments; \\n\\n&#8226; additions or departures of key personnel; \\n\\n&#8226; competition from existing products or new products that may emerge; \\n\\n&#8226; issuance of new or updated research or reports about us or our industry, or positive or negative recommendations or withdrawal of research coverage by securities analysts; \\n\\n&#8226; our failure to meet the estimates and projections of the investment community or that we may otherwise provide to the public; \\n\\n&#8226; fluctuations in the valuation of companies perceived by investors to be comparable to us; \\n\\n&#8226; disputes or other developments related to proprietary rights, including patents, and our ability to obtain intellectual property protection for our products; \\n\\n&#8226; litigation or regulatory matters; \\n\\n&#8226; announcement or expectation of additional financing efforts; \\n\\n&#8226; our cash position; \\n\\n&#8226; our indebtedness and ability to pay such indebtedness, as well as our ability to comply with covenants under our credit agreement; \\n\\n&#8226; sales of our common stock by our stockholders; \\n\\n&#8226; issuance of equity or debt; \\n\\n&#8226; share price and volume fluctuations attributable to inconsistent trading volume levels of our common stock; \\n\\n&#8226; changes in accounting practices; \\n\\n&#8226; ineffectiveness of our internal controls; \\n\\n&#8226; short-selling of our common stock; \\n\\n&#8226; negative media or marketing campaigns undertaken by our competitors or lobbyists supporting the meat industry; \\n\\n&#8226; the public&#8217;s response to publicity relating to the health aspects or nutritional value of our products; \\n\\n&#8226; the effects of COVID-19 and any other pandemic, epidemic or other public health crisis; and \\n\\n&#8226; other events or factors, many of which are beyond our control. \\n\\nFurthermore, the stock markets have experienced price and volume fluctuations that have affected and continue to affect the market prices of equity securities of many companies. These fluctuations often have been unrelated or disproportionate to the operating performance of those companies. These broad market and industry fluctuations, as well as general economic, political and market conditions such as recessions, interest rate changes, tariffs, international currency fluctuations, or the effects of disease outbreaks or pandemics (such as COVID-19), may negatively impact the market price of our common stock. In the past, companies that have experienced volatility in the market price of their stock have been subject to securities class action litigation. For example, in the past, we have been subject to multiple shareholder derivative lawsuits related, in part, to a securities case filed against us alleging federal securities law violations with respect to past disclosure, which case has since been dismissed with prejudice. Securities litigation, and any other type of litigation, brought against us could result in substantial costs and divert our management&#8217;s attention from other business concerns, which could seriously harm our business and adversely affect our results of operations. \\n\\nFuture sales of our common stock in the public market could cause our share price to fall. \\n\\nSales of a substantial number of shares of our common stock in the public market could occur at any time. These sales, or the perception in the market that the holders of a large number of shares of common stock intend to sell shares, could reduce the market price of our common stock. Moreover, certain holders of our common stock have rights, subject to certain conditions, to require us to file registration statements covering their shares or to include their shares in registration statements that we may file for ourselves or other stockholders. We also have registered all shares of common stock that we may issue under our equity compensation plans following the IPO or that are issuable upon exercise of outstanding options following the \\n\\nIPO. These shares can be freely sold in the public market upon issuance and once vested, subject to volume limitations applicable to affiliates. If any of these additional shares are sold, or if it is perceived that they will be sold, in the public market, the market price of our common stock could decline. \\n\\nIf securities or industry analysts issue an adverse or misleading opinion regarding our business or publish unfavorable research about our business, our share price and trading volume could decline. \\n\\nThe trading market for our common stock depends in part on the research and reports that industry or securities analysts publish about us or our business. If one or more of the analysts who cover us ceases coverage of our company or fails to publish reports on us regularly, we could lose visibility in the financial markets, which in turn could cause our share price or trading volume to decline. Moreover, if any of the analysts who cover us downgrade our stock or issue an adverse or misleading opinion regarding us, our business model or our stock performance, or if our operating results fail to meet the expectations of the investor community, our share price could decline. \\n\\nWe have never paid dividends on our capital stock and we do not intend to pay dividends for the foreseeable future. Consequently, any gains from an investment in our common stock will likely depend on whether the price of our common stock increases. \\n\\nWe have never declared or paid any dividends on our common stock and do not intend to pay any dividends in the foreseeable future. We anticipate that we will retain all of our future earnings for use in the operation of our business and for general corporate purposes. Accordingly, investors should rely on sales of their common stock after price appreciation, which may never occur, as the only way to realize any future gains on their investments. \\n\\nOur charter documents and Delaware law could prevent a takeover that stockholders consider favorable and could also reduce the market price of our stock. \\n\\nOur restated certificate of incorporation and our amended and restated bylaws contain provisions that could delay or prevent a change in control of our company. These provisions could also make it more difficult for stockholders to elect directors and take other corporate actions. These provisions include: \\n\\n&#8226; providing for a classified board of directors with staggered, three-year terms; \\n\\n&#8226; authorizing our board of directors to issue preferred stock with voting or other rights or preferences that could discourage a takeover attempt or delay changes in control; \\n\\n&#8226; prohibiting cumulative voting in the election of directors; \\n\\n&#8226; providing that vacancies on our board of directors may be filled only by a majority of directors then in office, even though less than a quorum; \\n\\n&#8226; prohibiting the adoption, amendment or repeal of our amended and restated bylaws or the repeal of the provisions of our restated certificate of incorporation regarding the election and removal of directors without the required approval of at least 66.67% of the shares entitled to vote at an election of directors; \\n\\n&#8226; prohibiting stockholder action by written consent; \\n\\n&#8226; limiting the persons who may call special meetings of stockholders; and \\n\\n&#8226; requiring advance notification of stockholder nominations and proposals, including without limitation, compliance with the requirements of Rule 14a-19 under the Exchange Act, as applicable. \\n\\nThese provisions may frustrate or prevent any attempts by our stockholders to replace or remove our current management by making it more difficult for stockholders to replace members of our board of directors, which is responsible for appointing the members of our management. In addition, the provisions of Section 203 of the Delaware General Corporate Law, or the DGCL, govern us. These provisions may prohibit large \\n\\nstockholders, in particular those owning 15% or more of our outstanding voting stock, from merging or combining with us for a certain period of time without the consent of our board of directors. \\n\\nThese and other provisions in our restated certificate of incorporation and our amended and restated bylaws and under Delaware law could discourage potential takeover attempts, reduce the price investors might be willing to pay in the future for shares of our common stock and result in the market price of our common stock being lower than it would be without these provisions. \\n\\nOur restated certificate of incorporation provides that the Court of Chancery of the State of Delaware and the federal district courts of the United States of America will be the exclusive forums for substantially all disputes between us and our stockholders, which could limit our stockholders&#8217; ability to obtain a favorable judicial forum for disputes with us or our directors, officers, or employees. \\n\\nOur restated certificate of incorporation provides that the Court of Chancery of the State of Delaware is the exclusive forum for: \\n\\n&#8226; any derivative action or proceeding brought on our behalf; \\n\\n&#8226; any action asserting a claim of breach of a fiduciary duty owed by, or other wrongdoing by, any of our directors, officers, employees or agents to us or our stockholders; \\n\\n&#8226; any action asserting a claim against us arising pursuant to any provision of the DGCL, our restated certificate of incorporation, or our amended and restated bylaws; \\n\\n&#8226; any action to interpret, apply, enforce or determine the validity of our restated certificate of incorporation or our amended and restated bylaws; and \\n\\n&#8226; any action asserting a claim against us that is governed by the internal affairs doctrine; \\n\\nprovided, that with respect to any derivative action or proceeding brought on our behalf to enforce any liability or duty created by the Exchange Act or the rules and regulations thereunder, the exclusive forum will be the federal district courts of the United States of America. Our restated certificate of incorporation further provides that the federal district courts of the United States of America will be the exclusive forum for resolving any complaint asserting a cause of action arising under the Securities Act. \\n\\nThese exclusive forum provisions may limit a stockholder&#8217;s ability to bring a claim in a judicial forum that it finds favorable for disputes with us or our directors, officers, or other employees, which may discourage lawsuits against us and our directors, officers and other employees. \\n\\nOur ability to utilize our federal net operating loss and tax credit carryforwards may be limited under Sections 382 and 383 of the Internal Revenue Code (the &#8220;Code&#8221;). \\n\\nAs of December 31, 2022, we had accumulated federal, state and foreign net operating loss carryforwards of approximately $744.5 million, $314.2 million and $84.1 million, respectively. Approximately $652.7 million of the federal net operating losses and $84.9 million of the state net operating losses do not expire and the remaining federal, state and foreign tax loss carryforwards begin to expire in 2031, 2031 and 2025, respectively, unless previously utilized. Utilization of the Company&#8217;s net operating loss and tax credit carryforwards may be subject to a substantial annual limitation due to the ownership change limitations provided by the Code and similar state provisions. \\n\\nThe limitations apply if a corporation undergoes an &#8220;ownership change,&#8221; which is generally defined as a greater than 50 percentage point change (by value) in its equity ownership by certain stockholders over a three-year period. We have experienced several ownership changes none of which is expected to result in a material limitation on the future use of our net operating loss and credit carryforwards generated prior to these ownership changes. However, any future changes in our stock ownership, which may be outside of our control, may trigger an ownership change and, consequently, Section 382 and 383 limitations. Similar provisions of state tax law \\n\\nmay also apply to limit our use of accumulated state tax attributes. As a result, if we earn net taxable income, our ability to use our pre-change net operating loss carryforwards and other tax attributes to offset such taxable income may be subject to limitations, which could potentially result in increased future income tax liability to us. We are currently analyzing whether and to what extent we have experienced an ownership change pursuant to Section 382; and to the extent such change occurred, the impact to the availability of our tax attributes. \\n\\n\""

no history of paying dividends or \\n\\nplans to pay dividends to our stockholders in the foreseeable future; provisions included in our charter documents to delay or prevent a change in control of our company; limitation of stockholders’ ability to obtain a favorable judicial forum for disputes due to the exclusive forum provision in our restated certificate of incorporation; and limitation of our ability to utilize our federal net operating loss and tax credit carryforwards. \\n\\nRisk Factors \\n\\nRisks Related to Our Business \\n\\nDisruptions in the worldwide economy, including an economic recession, downturn, periods of inflation or economic uncertainty, have and may continue to adversely affect our business, results of operations and financial condition. \\n\\nThe global economy can be negatively impacted by a variety of factors such as the spread or fear of spread of contagious diseases (such as the COVID-19 pandemic, other pandemics, epidemics or other public health crises) in locations where our products are sold, man-made or natural disasters, severe weather, actual or threatened hostilities or war, terrorist activity, political unrest, civil strife and other geopolitical uncertainty. Such adverse and uncertain economic conditions may impact distributor, retailer, foodservice and consumer demand for our products. For example, in connection with the war in Ukraine, governments in the U.S., U.K. and the EU have each imposed export controls on certain products and financial and economic sanctions on certain industry sectors and parties in Russia. The uncertainty resulting from the military conflict in Europe has given rise and may continue to give rise to increases in costs of goods and services, scarcity of certain ingredients, increased trade barriers or restrictions on global trade and may increase volatility in financial and capital markets, which may make it more difficult for us to raise additional capital. Further escalation of geopolitical tensions could have a broader impact that expands into other markets where we do business, which could adversely affect our business and/or our supply chain, our international subsidiaries, business partners or customers in the broader region, including potential destabilizing effects that such conflicts may pose for the European continent or the global oil and natural gas markets. In addition, our ability to manage normal commercial relationships with our suppliers, co-manufacturers, distributors, retailers, foodservice customers, consumers and creditors may suffer. \\n\\nStarting in 2020, the COVID-19 pandemic had a significant impact on the worldwide economy and, in turn, our business, financial condition and results of operations. Although we expect the impacts of the pandemic, and the resulting effects on the economy, on us to continue to decline, we are likely to see certain prolonged effects. For example, certain of our QSR customers reduced their menu offerings in response to COVID-19, which negatively impacted plant-based food items. If those customers are slow to re-expand their menus, or choose not to put plant-based products back on their menus, our business could be adversely affected. \\n\\nAs global economic conditions continue to be volatile or uncertain and recessionary or inflationary pressures exist, trends in consumer discretionary spending also remain unpredictable and subject to changes. We have seen consumers shift purchases to lower-priced or other perceived value offerings during economic downturns as a result of various factors, including job losses, inflation, higher taxes, reduced access to credit, change in federal economic policy and recent international trade disputes. In particular, consumers have reduced the amount of plant-based food products that they purchase where there are conventional animal-based protein offerings, which generally have lower retail prices. In addition, consumers may choose to purchase private label products rather than branded products because they are generally less expensive. A decrease in consumer discretionary spending may also result in consumers reducing the frequency and amount spent on food prepared away from home. Distributors, retailers and foodservice customers have become more conservative in response to these conditions and have sought to reduce their inventories. Our results of operations depend upon, among other things, our ability to maintain and increase sales volume with our existing distributors, retailer and foodservice customers, our ability to attract new consumers, the financial condition of our consumers and our ability to provide products that appeal to consumers at the right price. Decreases in demand for our products without a corresponding decrease in costs has put downward pressure on margins and has and may continue to negatively impact our financial results. Prolonged unfavorable economic \\n\\nconditions or uncertainty would be expected to have an adverse effect on our sales and profitability and may result in consumers making long-lasting changes to their discretionary spending behavior on a more permanent basis. \\n\\nInflationary price pressures of raw materials, labor, transportation, fuel or other inputs used by us and our suppliers, including the effects of rising interest rates, has negatively impacted, and could continue to negatively impact, our business and results of operations. \\n\\nOur operating environment has been impacted by inflation and rising interest rates. Increases in the price of raw materials, labor, wages, energy or other inputs that we or our suppliers use in manufacturing and supplying products, along with logistics, transportation, shipping, fuel and other related costs, has led to higher production and shipping costs for our products. Any increase in the cost of inputs to our production has led to higher costs for our products in our foodservice and retail channels and has negatively impacted and may continue to negatively impact our operating results and future profitability. General inflation, including rising energy prices, interest rates and wages, currency volatility and monetary, fiscal and policy interventions by national or regional governments in reaction to such events could continue to have negative impacts on our business by increasing our operating costs and our borrowing costs as well as decreasing the capital available for our customers to purchase our products. The United States Federal Reserve has raised its benchmark interest rate multiple times. Several other central banks, including the European Central Bank, have signaled increases in benchmark interest rates. Increased borrowing costs faced by our customers could result in decreased demand for our products. The impact of inflation could also reduce consumer confidence and decrease consumer discretionary spending, including spending to purchase our products, and negatively affect trends in consumer purchasing patterns due to changes in consumers’ disposable income, credit availability and debt levels. The impact of high inflation and the plant-based meat sector’s premium pricing relative to animal protein have caused and could continue to cause consumers to trade down into cheaper forms of protein, including animal meat. \\n\\nWe have a history of losses, and we may be unable to achieve or sustain profitability. \\n\\nWe have experienced net losses in almost every period since our inception. In 2022, 2021 and 2020, we incurred net losses of $366.1 million, $182.1 million and $52.8 million, respectively. Although we anticipate decreasing our operating expenses in 2023, over time our operating expenses and capital expenditures may increase as we hire additional employees; support our strategic and other QSR customer relationships; innovate and commercialize products; build our brand, expand our marketing channels and drive consumer adoption of our products; continue to invest to expand our production capacity through our own internal production facilities, domestically and abroad; build out our Campus Headquarters; increase our customer base, supplier network and co-manufacturing partners; scale production across distribution channels; pursue geographic expansion; and enhance our technology and production capabilities. These efforts may prove more expensive than we anticipate, and we may not succeed in increasing our revenues and margins sufficiently to offset the anticipated higher expenses. We incur significant expenses in developing our innovative products, building out our facilities, securing an adequate supply of raw materials, obtaining and storing ingredients and other products and marketing the products we offer. In addition, many of our expenses, including some of the costs associated with our existing and any future manufacturing facilities, are fixed. Accordingly, we may not be able to successfully implement our new sustainable growth strategy or achieve or sustain profitability, and we may incur significant losses for the foreseeable future. \\n\\nOur strategic initiatives to reduce our cost structure towards cash flow positive operations could have long-term adverse effects on our business, and we may not realize the operational or financial benefits from such actions. \\n\\nOur cost-reduction initiatives, expected charges and savings related to our recent workforce reductions and executive leadership changes, and the timing and success of achieving our cash flow positive targets are subject to many risks and uncertainties. The charges associated with the reduction-in-force and executive leadership changes may be greater than anticipated, completion of the reduction-in-force may take longer than anticipated, we may be unable to realize the contemplated benefits in connection with the workforce reduction, executive leadership changes and other potential cost-reduction initiatives, and the workforce reduction, \\n\\nexecutive leadership changes and cost-reduction initiatives may have an adverse impact on our performance. Additionally, our ability to meet our cash flow positive targets is subject to a number of assumptions and uncertainties, including, without limitation, our ability to reduce costs and achieve positive gross margins; our ability to meet certain revenue and operating expense targets, which may be subject to factors beyond our control; and our ability to monetize inventory and manage working capital. The other risks described in this report may also hinder our ability to implement our strategic initiatives. \\n\\nAs we continue to identify areas of cost savings and operating efficiencies, we may consider implementing further measures to help streamline operations and improve our cost efficiencies, including downsizing or exiting certain operations. However, our strategic growth initiatives may not be adequate to support the long-term operations of our business, particularly under adverse circumstances, Furthermore, we may not be successful in implementing these initiatives or realizing our anticipated savings and efficiencies, including as a result of factors beyond our control. In the event we have excess capacity or vacancy in any of our facilities or office spaces, we may sublease portions of the excess space to third parties and may be unable to sublease our excess space on favorable terms, or at all, or if we are able to sublease space but our subtenants fail to make lease payments to us or otherwise default on their obligations to us, we could incur substantial payment obligations to our landlords. If we are unable to realize the anticipated savings and efficiencies of our cost reduction initiatives and related strategic initiatives, our operating and financial results would be adversely affected and could differ materially from our expectations. \\n\\nOur inability to streamline operations and improve cost efficiencies could result in the contraction of our business and the implementation of significant cost cutting measures. \\n\\nWe have undertaken efforts to streamline operations and improve cost efficiencies, including related to our supply chain, marketing and commercialization efforts. For example, on August 3, 2022 and October 14, 2022, we announced reductions-in-force affecting approximately 4% and 19%, respectively, of our global workforce. We may not realize, in full or in part, the anticipated benefits, savings and improvements in our operating results from these efforts due to unforeseen difficulties, delays or unexpected costs. If we are unable to realize the expected operational efficiencies and cost savings, our operating results and financial condition would be adversely affected. We also cannot guarantee that we will not have to undertake additional workforce reductions in the future. Furthermore, our workforce reductions may be disruptive to our operations. For example, our workforce reductions could yield unanticipated consequences, such as attrition beyond planned staff reductions, increased difficulties in our day-to-day operations and reduced employee morale. In addition, while positions have been eliminated, certain functions necessary to our reduced operations remain, and we may be unsuccessful in distributing the duties and obligations of departed employees among our remaining employees. We may also discover that the reductions in workforce and cost cutting measures will make it difficult for us to pursue new opportunities and initiatives and require us to hire qualified replacement personnel, which may require us to incur additional and unanticipated costs and expenses. Moreover, there is no assurance we will be successful in our efforts. Our failure to successfully accomplish any of the above activities and goals may have a material adverse impact on our business, financial condition, and results of operations. \\n\\nIf we fail to effectively expand or optimize our manufacturing and production capacity, accurately forecast demand for our products or quickly respond to forecast changes, our business and operating results and our brand reputation could be harmed. \\n\\nIf we do not have sufficient capacity to meet our customers’ demands and to satisfy increased demand, or are not able to streamline and optimize manufacturing capacity for specific products, we will need to expand our operations, supply and manufacturing capabilities. However, there is risk in our ability to effectively scale production processes, optimize manufacturing capacity for specific products and effectively manage our supply chain requirements. We must accurately forecast demand for each of our products and inventory needs in order to ensure we have adequate available manufacturing capacity for each such product and to ensure we are effectively managing our inventory. Our forecasts are based on multiple assumptions which may cause our estimates to be inaccurate and affect our ability to obtain adequate manufacturing capacity (whether our own manufacturing capacity or co-manufacturing capacity) and adequate inventory supply in order to meet the \\n\\ndemand for our products, which could prevent us from meeting increased customer demand and harm our brand and our business and in some cases may result in fines or indemnification obligations we must pay customers or distributors if we are unable to fulfill orders placed by them in a timely manner or at all. \\n\\nConsumer demand for plant-based meat products has recently cooled down. For example, in the fourth quarter of 2022, all of our markets and channels were negatively impacted by softness in demand. If consumer demand for plant-based meats continues to decrease, or if any such decrease is prolonged, demand for our products by our customers may also decrease, which could in turn have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. \\n\\nFurthermore, if we do not accurately align our manufacturing capabilities and inventory supply with demand, if we experience disruptions or delays in our supply chain, or if we cannot obtain raw materials of sufficient quantity and quality at reasonable prices and in a timely manner, our business, financial condition and results of operations may be materially adversely affected. \\n\\nWe may not be able to utilize our capacity efficiently or accurately plan our capacity requirements, which may adversely affect our gross margin, business and operating results. \\n\\nIf we overestimate our demand and overbuild our capacity or inventory, we may have significantly underutilized assets. Underutilization of our manufacturing and/or co-manufacturing facilities can adversely affect our gross margin and other operating results. If demand for our products experiences a prolonged decrease, we may be required to terminate or make penalty-type payments under certain supply chain arrangements, close or idle facilities and write down our long-lived assets or shorten the useful lives of underutilized assets and accelerate depreciation, which would increase our expenses. \\n\\nIf demand does not materialize at the rate forecasted, we may not be able to scale back our manufacturing expenses or overhead costs quickly enough to correspond to the lower than expected demand. This could result in lower margins and adversely impact our business and results of operations. Additionally, if product demand decreases or we fail to forecast demand accurately, our results may be adversely impacted due to higher costs resulting from lower manufacturing utilization, causing higher fixed costs per unit produced. Further, we may be required to recognize excess or obsolete inventory write-off charges, or excess capacity charges, which would have a negative impact on our results of operations. \\n\\nIf we are unable to sell our inventory in a timely manner, it could become obsolete, which could require us to write-down or write-off obsolete inventory, which could harm our operating results. \\n\\nThere is a risk that we may be unable to sell our inventory in a timely manner to avoid it becoming obsolete. If we are required to substantially discount our inventory or are unable to sell our inventory in a timely manner, we would be required to increase our inventory reserves or write off obsolete inventory and our operating results could be substantially harmed. Alternatively, we may be required to mark down certain products to sell any excess inventory or to sell such inventory through liquidation channels at significantly lower prices, which would negatively impact our business and operating results. In the year ended December 31, 2022, our net revenues were negatively impacted by strategic price reductions, and our gross profit was negatively impacted by higher inventory reserves, which increased costs per pound. \\n\\nOur ability to accurately forecast our future results of operations is subject to many risks and uncertainties and our operating and financial results could differ materially from our expectations. \\n\\nOur ability to accurately forecast our future results of operations is limited and subject to a number of risks and uncertainties. Our historical revenue growth should not be considered indicative of our future performance and our revenue growth could slow or our revenue could decline for a number of reasons, including slowing demand for our products, increasing competition from our market competitors and new market entrants, and a decrease in the growth of our overall market. In fact, net revenues in the year ended December 31, 2022 decreased by $45.8 million, or 9.8%, as compared to the prior year. If we are unable to identify and execute cost-down initiatives intended to achieve price parity with animal protein, we may not be able to compete effectively in our market, demand for our products may continue to slow and could continue to adversely affect \\n\\nour revenues and margins. If our assumptions regarding these risks and uncertainties and our future revenue growth are incorrect or change, or if we do not address these risks successfully, our operating and financial results could differ materially from our expectations, and our business could suffer. \\n\\nFrom time to time, we may release earnings guidance, financial goals or other forward-looking statements in our earnings releases, earnings conference calls or otherwise regarding our future performance that represent our management’s estimates as of the date of the release. Some or all of the assumptions of any future guidance or financial goals that we furnish may not materialize or may vary significantly from actual future results. For example, our ability to meet our cash flow positive targets is subject to a number of assumptions and uncertainties, including, without limitation, our ability to reduce costs and achieve positive gross margins; our ability to meet certain revenue and operating expense targets, which may be subject to factors beyond our control; and our ability to monetize inventory and manage working capital. \\n\\nWe estimate market opportunity and forecast market growth that may prove to be inaccurate, and even if the market in which we compete achieves the forecasted growth, our business could fail to grow at similar rates, if at all. \\n\\nOur estimates of market opportunity and growth forecasts are subject to significant uncertainty and are based on assumptions and estimates that may prove to be inaccurate. The factors that go into the calculation of our market opportunity are subject to change over time and may be variable or inaccurate and may be affected by increasing competition from our market competitors and new market entrants. Any expansion in our market depends on a number of factors, including the cost and perceived value associated with our product and those of our competitors. Even if the market in which we compete meets the size estimates and growth forecast, our business could fail to grow at the rate we anticipate, if at all. Our growth is subject to many factors, including our success in implementing our business strategy, which is subject to many risks and uncertainties. \\n\\nBecause we rely on a limited number of third-party suppliers, we may not be able to obtain raw materials on a timely basis or in sufficient quantities at competitive prices to produce our products or meet the demand for our products. \\n\\nWe rely on a limited number of vendors, a portion of which are located internationally, to supply us with raw materials. Our financial performance depends in large part on our ability to arrange for the purchase of raw materials in sufficient quantities at competitive prices. We have entered into a multi-year sales agreement for plant-based protein with one of our pea protein suppliers pursuant to which we are required to purchase specified minimum monthly and semi-annual quantities through the term. In addition, we have entered into a supply agreement with another supplier pursuant to which we obtain pea protein on a purchase order basis and have the right to cancel purchase orders if we provide timely written notice. The amount purchased in each quarter of 2023 is mutually agreed upon by us and the supplier prior to each quarter and becomes a binding quarterly commitment upon such agreement. Other than pursuant to these agreements, we are not assured of continued supply or pricing of raw materials. Any of our other suppliers could discontinue or seek to alter their relationship with us. We have in the past experienced interruptions in the supply of pea protein from one supplier that resulted in delays in delivery to us. We could experience similar delays in the future from any of our suppliers. Any disruption in the supply of pea protein or other raw materials would have a material adverse effect on our business if we cannot replace these suppliers in a timely manner, on commercially reasonable terms, or at all. \\n\\nIn addition, our pea protein suppliers manufacture their products at a limited number of facilities. A natural disaster, severe weather, fire, power interruption, work stoppage or other calamity affecting any of these facilities, or any interruption in their operations, could negatively impact our ability to obtain required quantities of pea protein in a timely manner, or at all, which could materially reduce our product sales and net revenues, and have a material adverse effect on our business and financial condition. \\n\\nEvents that adversely affect our suppliers of pea protein and other raw materials could impair our ability to obtain raw material inventory in the quantities at competitive prices that we desire. Such events include problems with our suppliers’ businesses, finances, labor relations and/or shortages, strikes or other labor \\n\\nunrest, ability to import raw materials, product quality issues, costs, production, insurance and reputation, as well as local economic and political conditions, restrictive U.S. and foreign governmental actions, such as restrictions on transfers of funds and trade protection measures, including export/import duties and quotas and customs duties and tariffs, adverse fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates, changes in legal or regulatory requirements, border closures, disease outbreaks or pandemics (such as COVID-19), acts of war, terrorism, natural disasters, fires, earthquakes, flooding, severe weather, agricultural diseases or other catastrophic occurrences. We continuously seek alternative sources of protein to use in our products, but we may not be successful in diversifying the raw materials we use in our products. \\n\\nIf we need to replace an existing supplier, there can be no assurance that supplies of raw materials will be available when required on acceptable terms, or at all, or that a new supplier would allocate sufficient capacity to us in order to meet our requirements, fill our orders in a timely manner or meet our strict quality standards. If we are unable to manage our supply chain effectively and ensure that our products are available to meet consumer demand, we may not be able to fulfill customer orders, our operating costs could increase and our profit margins could decrease. \\n\\nDisruptions of our supply chain could have a material adverse effect on our operating and financial results. \\n\\nOur ability to make, move and sell products in coordination with our suppliers, third party contract manufacturers and distributors is critical to our success. Damage or disruption to our collective supply, manufacturing or distribution capabilities resulting from severe weather, fires or evacuations related thereto, natural disasters, including climate-related events, pandemics (such as the COVID-19 pandemic) or other outbreaks of contagious diseases, agricultural diseases, cyber incidents, terrorism, governmental restrictions or mandates, political instability, trade restrictions, import restrictions, border closures, freight carrier availability, labor shortages, strikes or other labor unrest, the financial or operational instability of key suppliers and carriers, repairs or enhancements at facilities manufacturing or delivering our products or other reasons could impair our ability to source inputs or manufacture, sell or timely deliver our products. To the extent we are unable to mitigate the likelihood or potential impact of such events, there could be a material adverse effect on our operating and financial results. \\n\\nAdditionally, there are increasing expectations in various jurisdictions that companies monitor the environmental and social performance of their suppliers, including compliance with a variety of labor practices, as well as consider a wider range of potential environmental and social matters, including the end of life considerations for products. Compliance can be costly, require us to establish or augment programs to diligence or monitor our suppliers, or, in the case of legislation such as the Uyghur Forced Labor Prevention Act, to design supply chains to avoid certain suppliers or regions altogether. Failure to comply with such regulations can result in fines, reputational damage, import ineligibility for certain products or raw materials, or otherwise adversely impact our business. \\n\\nOur future business, results of operations and financial condition may be adversely affected by reduced or limited availability of plant-based protein that meets our standards. \\n\\nOur ability to ensure a continuing supply of ingredients at competitive prices depends on many factors beyond our control, such as the number and size of farms that grow certain crops such as Canadian, European and North American yellow peas, the vagaries of these farming businesses (including poor harvests impacting the quality of the peas grown), changes in national and world economic conditions, including as a result of COVID-19 or the outbreak of hostilities or war, tariffs and our ability to forecast our ingredient requirements. The high-quality ingredients used in many of our products are vulnerable to adverse weather conditions and natural disasters, such as floods, droughts, frosts, earthquakes, hurricanes and pestilence. Adverse weather conditions and natural disasters can lower crop yields and reduce crop size and quality, which in turn could reduce the available supply of, or increase the price of, quality ingredients. In addition, we purchase some ingredients and other materials offshore, and the price and availability of such ingredients and materials may be affected by political events or other conditions in these countries or tariffs, trade wars or the outbreak of hostilities or war. We also compete with other food producers in the procurement of ingredients, and this competition may \\n\\nincrease in the future if consumer demand for plant-based meat products increases. If supplies of quality ingredients are reduced or there is greater demand for such ingredients from us and others, we may not be able to obtain sufficient supply that meets our strict quality standards on favorable terms, or at all, which could impact our ability to supply products and may adversely affect our business, results of operations and financial condition. \\n\\nWe rely on a limited number of distributors, and if we experience the loss of one or more distributors and cannot replace them in a timely manner, our results of operations may be adversely affected. \\n\\nMany retailers and foodservice providers purchase our products through distributors who purchase, store, sell, and deliver our products to such retailers and foodservice providers. For 2022, DOT accounted for 12% of our gross revenues. For 2021, DOT and Zandbergen WFM accounted for approximately 12% and 11% of our gross revenues, respectively. Since these distributors act as intermediaries between us and the retailers and foodservice providers, we do not have short-term or long-term commitments or minimum purchase volumes in our contracts with them that ensure future sales of our products. If we lose one or more of our distributors and cannot replace the distributor in a timely manner or at all, our business, results of operation and financial condition may be materially adversely affected. \\n\\nIf we fail to cost-effectively acquire new customers or retain our existing customers, or if we fail to derive revenue from our existing customers consistent with our historical performance, our business could be materially adversely affected. \\n\\nOur success, and our ability to increase revenues and operate profitably, depends in part on our ability to cost-effectively acquire new customers, to retain existing customers, and to keep existing customers engaged so that they continue to purchase products from us. We intend to continue to expand our number of foodservice customers, both in the United States and internationally, as part of our growth strategy. This may require us to provide marketing and other financial incentives to our customers to assist in the promotion of our products. Such additional incentives could have a negative impact on gross margin and may not necessarily result in increased sales. In addition, new national foodservice customers will often initially add certain of our product offerings to their menus at limited locations and/or on a limited test basis, after which time these customers may choose to no longer offer our products or may ultimately scale back subsequent expansions. If we fail to attract and retain new foodservice customers, or retain our existing foodservice customers, our business, financial condition and results of operations could be materially adversely affected. In addition, timing of retail shelf resets are not within our control, and to the extent that retail customers change the timing of such events, reduce our in store-displays or are not able to restock our products effectively, sales of our products may be impaired and negatively impact our revenues. \\n\\nFurther, if customers do not perceive our product offerings to be of sufficient value and quality, or if we fail to offer new and relevant product offerings at a competitive price, we may not be able to attract or retain customers or engage existing customers so that they continue to purchase products from us. We may lose customers to our competitors if they offer superior products to ours, if we are unable to compete on the basis of value and taste, if we are unable to meet customers’ orders in a timely manner, or if we are unable to identify and execute cost-down initiatives intended to achieve price parity with animal protein. The loss of any large customer or the reduction of purchasing levels or the cancellation of business from such customers could have a material adverse impact on our business. \\n\\nConsolidation of customers or the loss of a significant customer could negatively impact our sales and profitability. \\n\\nSupermarkets in North America and the European Union continue to consolidate. This consolidation has produced larger, more sophisticated organizations with increased negotiating and buying power that are able to resist price increases, as well as operate with lower inventories, decrease the number of brands that they carry and increase their emphasis on private label products, all of which could negatively impact our business. The consolidation of retail customers also increases the risk that a significant adverse impact on their business could have a corresponding material adverse impact on our business. \\n\\nThe loss of any large customer, the reduction of purchasing levels or the cancellation of any business from a large customer for an extended length of time could negatively impact our sales and profitability. For example, in 2022, the year-over-year decrease in our U.S. foodservice channel net revenues was driven primarily by sales to a large QSR customer in the year-ago period that did not repeat in the fourth quarter of 2022. \\n\\nFurthermore, as retailers consolidate, they may reduce the number of branded products they offer in order to accommodate private label products and generate more competitive terms from branded suppliers competing for limited retailer shelf space. Consequently, our financial results may fluctuate significantly from period to period based on the actions of one or more significant retailers. A retailer may take actions that affect us for reasons that we cannot always anticipate or control, such as their financial condition, changes in their business strategy or operations, the introduction of competing products, pricing and promotions, shelf reset timing and activity, reduced in store-displays, timing of product restocking or the perceived quality of our products. Despite operating in different channels, our retailers sometimes compete for the same consumers as our foodservice channel. Because of actual or perceived conflicts resulting from this competition, retailers may take actions that negatively affect us. \\n\\nLoss of one or more of our co-manufacturers or our failure to timely identify and establish relationships with new co-manufacturers could harm our business and impede our growth. \\n\\nA significant amount of our revenue is derived from products manufactured at manufacturing facilities owned and operated by our co-manufacturers, a portion of which are located internationally. Any of the co-manufacturers with whom we do not have a written contract could seek to alter or terminate its relationship with us at any time, leaving us with periods during which we have limited or no ability to manufacture our products. If we need to replace a co-manufacturer, there can be no assurance that additional capacity will be available when required on acceptable terms, or at all. \\n\\nAn interruption in, or the loss of operations at, one or more of our co-manufacturing facilities, which may be caused by work stoppages, labor shortages, strikes or other labor unrest, production disruptions, product quality issues, local economic and political conditions, restrictive governmental actions, border closures, disease outbreaks or pandemics (such as COVID-19), the outbreak of hostilities, acts of war, terrorism, fire, earthquakes, severe weather, flooding or other natural disasters at one or more of these facilities, could delay, postpone or reduce production of some of our products, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition until such time as such interruption is resolved or an alternate source of production is secured. \\n\\nWe believe there are a limited number of competent, high-quality co-manufacturers in the industry that meet our strict quality and control standards, and as we seek to continue to obtain additional or alternative co-manufacturing arrangements in the future, there can be no assurance that we would be able to do so on satisfactory terms, in a timely manner, or at all. Additionally, as we expand our operations internationally, we will need to develop relationships with co-manufacturers overseas to meet sales demand, and there can be no assurance that we will be able to successfully do so. Therefore, the loss of one or more co-manufacturers, any disruption or delay at a co-manufacturer or any failure to identify and engage co-manufacturers for new products, product extensions and expanded operations could delay, postpone or reduce production of our products, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition. \\n\\nAny damage or disruption at our domestic or international manufacturing facilities may harm our business. \\n\\nWe have manufacturing facilities in the United States, China and the Netherlands to produce our woven proteins and our finished goods. A natural disaster, severe weather, fire, power interruption, work stoppage, labor shortages, strikes or other labor unrest, border closures, restrictive governmental actions, outbreaks of pandemics or contagious diseases (such as COVID-19) or other calamity at any of these facilities would significantly disrupt our ability to deliver our products and operate our business. If any material amount of our machinery or inventory were damaged, we would be unable to meet our contractual obligations and cannot \\n\\npredict when, if at all, we could replace or repair such machinery, which could materially adversely affect our business, financial condition and operating results. \\n\\nOur business could be adversely affected by a workplace accident or safety incident. \\n\\nOur manufacturing processes and related activities could expose us to significant personal injury claims that could subject us to substantial liability. Specifically, our inability to anticipate or preempt potential workplace hazards, create safe working environments or timely adapt to changing requirements around maintaining a safe workplace could result in employee illness, accidents or other safety incidents. A failure to properly train our employees regarding, or respond appropriately and in a timely manner to, any such illness, accident or safety incident could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operation and reputation. While we maintain liability insurance in amounts and of the type generally consistent with industry practice, the amount of such coverage may not be adequate to cover fully all claims, and we may be forced to bear substantial losses from an accident or safety incident resulting from our manufacturing activities. \\n\\nWe may not successfully ramp up operations at our facilities or these facilities may not operate in accordance with our expectations. Moreover, we face competition for employees and may be unable to hire and retain employees at these facilities. \\n\\nSince June 2018, we have acquired facilities by purchase or lease in the United States, China and the Netherlands. Any substantial delay in bringing these facilities up to full production on our current schedule may hinder our ability to produce all of the product needed to meet orders and/or achieve our expected financial performance. Opening these facilities has required, and will continue to require, additional capital expenditures and the efforts and attention of our management and other personnel, which has and will continue to divert resources from our existing business or operations. These efforts may prove more expensive than we anticipate, and we may not succeed in increasing our revenues and margins sufficiently to offset the anticipated higher expenses. Additionally, our inability to hire and retain skilled employees at these facilities will severely hamper our expansion plans, product development and manufacturing efforts. The unemployment rate in the Columbia, Missouri market was 2.8% as of December 2022 and labor market conditions remain relatively tight. As a result, we currently rely on temporary workers in addition to full-time employees, and in the future, we may be unable to attract and retain employees with the skills we require, which could impact our ability to expand our operations. Even if our facilities are brought up to full production according to our current schedule, it may not provide us with all of the operational and financial benefits we expect to receive. \\n\\nOur facilities and the manufacturing equipment we use to produce our products is costly to replace or repair and may require substantial lead-time to do so. For example, our estimate of throughput or our extrusion capacity may be impacted by disruption from extruder lead-in time, calibration, maintenance and unexpected delays. In addition, our ability to procure new extruders may face more lengthy lead times than is typical. We may also not be able to find suitable alternatives with co-manufacturers to replace the output from such equipment on a timely basis and at a reasonable cost. In the future, we may also experience plant shutdowns or periods of reduced production because of regulatory issues, equipment failure, delays in raw material deliveries or other adverse events. Any such disruption or unanticipated event may cause significant interruptions or delays in our business and the reduction or loss of inventory may render us unable to fulfill customer orders in a timely manner, or at all. We have property and business disruption insurance in place for all of our manufacturing facilities; however, such insurance coverage may not be sufficient to cover all of our potential losses and may not continue to be available to us on acceptable terms, or at all. \\n\\nWe may face difficulties as we expand our operations in other countries, including into those in which we have no prior operating experience. \\n\\nWe intend to continue to expand our global footprint and enter into new markets. International operations involve a number of risks, including labor shortages, strikes or other labor unrest, border closures, restrictive governmental actions, foreign regulatory compliance, tariffs, taxes and exchange controls, economic downturns, inflation, foreign currency fluctuations and political and social instability in the countries in which we operate. Expansion may involve expanding into countries other than those in which we currently operate. It may also involve expanding into less developed countries, which may have less political, social or economic stability and less developed infrastructure and legal systems. In addition, it may be difficult for us to understand and accurately predict taste preferences and purchasing habits of consumers in these new geographic markets. It is costly to establish, develop and maintain international operations and develop and promote our brands in international markets. As we expand our business into other countries, we may encounter regulatory, legal, personnel, technological and other difficulties that increase our expenses and/or delay our ability to become profitable in such countries, which may have a material adverse effect on our business and brand. \\n\\nOur revenue growth rate has fluctuated in recent periods and may continue to slow or decline in the future. \\n\\nWe experienced significant revenue growth in prior periods. However, our revenue growth and revenues have slowed or declined, with periods of negative growth, and may continue to slow or decline in future periods due to a number of potential factors, including without limitation, macroeconomic issues including inflation and rising interest rates, increasing concerns about the likelihood of a recession, and potential impacts on consumer and customer behavior, and demand levels, increasing competition, market saturation, slowing demand for our offerings, increasing regulatory costs and challenges, failure to capitalize on growth opportunities and the long-term effects of the COVID-19 pandemic. \\n\\nOur revenues and earnings may fluctuate as a result of our promotional activities. \\n\\nWe routinely offer sales discounts and promotions through various programs to customers and consumers which may result in reduced margins. These programs include rebates, temporary on-shelf price reductions, off-invoice discounts, retailer advertisements, product coupons and other trade activities. We anticipate that we will need to continue to offer more trade and promotion discounts to both our retail and foodservice customers, to drive increased consumer trial and in response to changing consumer behavior and increased competition. We expect to face increasing competition across all channels, especially as additional plant-based meat product brands continue to enter the marketplace. In response, we anticipate providing heavier discounting and promotions on some of our products. Although these actions are intended to build brand awareness and increase consumer trials of our products, they have had and are likely to continue to have a negative impact on our net revenues, gross profit, gross margin and profitability, impacting period-over-period results. \\n\\nFluctuations in our results of operations for our second and third quarters may impact, and may have a disproportionate effect on our overall financial condition and results of operations. \\n\\nOur business is subject to seasonal fluctuations that may have a disproportionate effect on our results of operations. Generally, we expect to experience greater demand for certain of our products during the summer grilling season. We continue to see additional seasonality effects, especially within our retail channel, with revenue contribution from this channel tending to be greater in the second and third quarters of the year, along with increased levels of purchasing by customers ahead of holidays, the impact of customer shelf reset activity and the timing of product restocking by our retail customers. Any factors that harm our second and third quarter operating results, including disruptions in our supply chain, adverse weather or unfavorable economic conditions, may have a disproportionate effect on our results of operations for the entire year. In an environment of recessionary and inflationary pressures, general softness in the plant-based category, competition and other factors impacting our business, including uncertainty around the long-term impacts of COVID-19, we are unable to assess the ultimate impact on the demand for our products as a result of seasonality. \\n\\nHistorical results are not indicative of future results. \\n\\nHistorical quarter-to-quarter and period-over-period comparisons of our sales and operating results are not necessarily indicative of future quarter-to-quarter and period-over-period results. You should not rely on the results of a single quarter or period as an indication of our annual results or our future performance. \\n\\nFailure by our transportation providers to deliver our products on time, or at all, could result in lost sales. \\n\\nWe currently rely upon third-party transportation providers for a significant portion of our product shipments. Our utilization of delivery services for shipments is subject to risks, including increases in fuel prices, which would increase our shipping costs, employee strikes, disease outbreaks or pandemics (such as COVID-19) and inclement weather, which may impact the ability of providers to provide delivery services that adequately meet our shipping needs, if at all. We periodically change shipping companies, and we could face logistical difficulties that could adversely affect deliveries. In addition, we could incur costs and expend resources in connection with such change. Moreover, we may not be able to obtain terms as favorable as those we receive from the third-party transportation providers that we currently use, which in turn would increase our costs and thereby adversely affect our operating results. \\n\\nWe have undergone, and may continue to experience, changes to our executive leadership team and senior management, and if we are unable to integrate new members of our executive leadership team or senior management, or if we fail to retain members of our executive leadership team and senior management, our business and operations may be adversely affected. \\n\\nOur success is substantially dependent on the continued service of certain members of our senior management, including Ethan Brown, our Founder, President and Chief Executive Officer. These executives have been primarily responsible for determining the strategic direction of our business and for executing our growth strategy and are integral to our brand, culture and the reputation we enjoy with suppliers, co-manufacturers, distributors, customers and consumers. The loss of the services of any of these executives could have a material adverse effect on our business and prospects, as we may not be able to find suitable individuals to replace them on a timely basis, if at all. In addition, any such departure could be viewed in a negative light by investors and analysts, which may cause the price of our common stock to decline. We do not currently carry key-person life insurance for our senior executives. \\n\\nFrom time to time, there may be changes in our executive leadership team and senior management as a result of the hiring, departure or realignment of key personnel, and such changes may impact our business. In 2021 and 2022, we have had several changes to our executive leadership team and senior management, including as a result of organizational changes based on cost-reduction initiatives. Any significant leadership change or senior management transition involves inherent risk and any failure to ensure the timely and suitable replacement and a smooth transition could hinder our strategic planning, business execution and future performance. In particular, these or any future leadership transitions may result in a loss of personnel with deep institutional or technical knowledge and changes in business strategy or objectives and have the potential to disrupt our operations and relationships with employees and customers due to added costs, operational inefficiencies, changes in strategy, decreased employee morale and productivity, and increased turnover. If we are unable to successfully integrate new executive leadership team members and senior management, our operations may be adversely affected and we may not be able to achieve our operating objectives. \\n\\nIf we are unable to attract, train and retain employees or maintain our company culture, we may not be able to grow or successfully operate our business. \\n\\nOur success depends in part upon our ability to attract, train and retain a sufficient number of employees who understand and appreciate our culture and can represent our brand effectively and establish credibility with our business partners and consumers. We believe a critical component of our success has been our company culture and long-standing core values. We have invested substantial time and resources in building our team. If we are unable to hire and retain employees capable of meeting our business needs and expectations, or if we \\n\\nfail to preserve our company culture among a larger number of employees dispersed in various geographic regions, our business and brand image may be impaired. Any failure to meet our staffing needs or any material increase in turnover rates of our employees or key personnel changes may adversely affect our business, results of operations and financial condition. \\n\\nFurthermore, in 2022, we implemented two reductions in force, which together impacted 19% of our global workforce. Although we believe these reductions will be an important part of the success of our cost-reduction initiatives, they may adversely affect employee morale, our culture and our ability to attract and retain critical employees. They may also negatively impact our ability to pursue new initiatives due to insufficient resources and personnel. We may be unsuccessful in distributing duties and obligations of impacted employees among the remaining employees. We also may not realize the anticipated benefits and cost savings and may suffer unintended consequences, such as the loss of institutional knowledge, higher than expected employee turnover and significant disruptions in our day-to-day operations. If we are unable to realize the expected operational efficiencies or cost savings from the reductions in force, or if we experience significant adverse consequences as a result, our business, financial conditions and results of operations may be adversely affected. \\n\\nSome of our international employees are employed by professional employer organizations. \\n\\nPrior to January 1, 2022, we contracted with a professional employer organization, or U.S. PEO, that administered our human resources, payroll and employee benefits functions for our employees in the United States. Effective as of January 1, 2022, such human resources, payroll and employee benefits functions are no longer performed by the U.S. PEO. We continue to contract with non-U.S. PEOs to perform the same functions as the U.S. PEO for the majority of our employees outside the United States. Although we recruit and select our workers, each of these workers is also an employee of record of the relevant non-U.S. PEO. As a result, these workers are compensated through the relevant PEO, are governed by the work policies created by the relevant PEO and receive their annual wage statements and other payroll or labor related reports from the relevant PEO (e.g., T-4s for employees in Canada). This relationship permits management to focus on operations and profitability rather than payroll administration, but this relationship also exposes us to some risks. Among other risks, if any of the non-U.S. PEOs fail to adequately withhold or pay employer taxes or to comply with applicable laws, we may be held liable for such violations notwithstanding any indemnification provisions with the non-U.S. PEOs. In certain non-U.S. jurisdictions, the worker may be deemed a direct employee and the potential liability for any non-compliance with applicable laws increases depending on whether a company has an entity or other corporate presence in the country, among other factors set forth under applicable local laws. \\n\\nCourt and administrative proceedings related to matters of employment tax, labor law and other laws applicable to PEO arrangements could distract management from our business and cause us to incur significant expense. If we were held liable for violations by PEOs, such amounts may adversely affect our profitability and could negatively affect our business and results of operations. \\n\\nWe depend on a limited number of third party service providers for the performance of several of our business operations, including payroll and human capital management services. \\n\\nIf any of these third party providers were to experience significant interruptions in their business operations, terminate their agreements with the company, or fail to perform the services required under the terms of the company’s contracts with them, its own processing could be materially and adversely affected for an indefinite period of time. There can be no assurance that the company would be able to locate alternative providers of such services, or that it could do so at economical rates. \\n\\nFuture acquisitions or investments could disrupt our business and harm our financial condition. \\n\\nIn the future, we may pursue acquisitions or investments that we believe will help us achieve our strategic objectives. We may not be able to find suitable acquisition candidates, and even if we do, we may not be able to complete acquisitions on favorable terms, if at all. If we do complete acquisitions, we may not ultimately achieve our goals or realize the anticipated benefits. The pursuit of acquisitions and any integration process will require significant time and resources and could divert management time and focus from operation of our then-existing \\n\\nbusiness, and we may not be able to manage the process successfully. Any acquisitions we complete could be viewed negatively by our customers or consumers. An acquisition, investment or business relationship may result in unforeseen operating difficulties and expenditures, including disrupting our ongoing operations and subjecting us to additional liabilities, increasing our expenses, and adversely impacting our business, financial condition and operating results. Moreover, we may be exposed to unknown liabilities related to the acquired company or product, and the anticipated benefits of any acquisition, investment or business relationship may not be realized if, for example, we fail to successfully integrate such acquisition into our company. To pay for any such acquisitions, we would have to use cash, incur debt, or issue debt or equity securities, each of which may affect our financial condition or the value of our common stock and could result in dilution to our stockholders. If we incur more debt it would result in increased fixed obligations and could also subject us to covenants or other restrictions that would impede our ability to manage our operations. Our acquisition strategy could require significant management attention, disrupt our business and harm our business, financial condition and results of operations. \\n\\nOur business and reputation could be negatively impacted by the increased scrutiny from our stakeholders and institutional investors on ESG practices. \\n\\nThere is an increased focus from a variety of stakeholders on corporate ESG practices, including climate change and related ESG disclosure requirements. Expectations regarding voluntary ESG initiatives and disclosures may result in increased costs (including but not limited to increased costs related to compliance, stakeholder engagement, contracting and insurance), changes in demand for certain products, enhanced compliance or disclosure obligations, or other adverse impacts to our business, financial condition, or results of operations. \\n\\nWhile we may at times engage in voluntary initiatives (such as voluntary disclosures, certifications, or goals, among others) to improve the ESG profile of our company and/or products, such initiatives or achievements of such commitments may be costly and may not have the desired effect. Expectations around the Company’s management of ESG matters continues to evolve rapidly, in many instances due to factors that are out of our control. For example, we may not ultimately be able to complete certain goals or initiatives, either on the timelines originally anticipated or at all, due to technical, cost, or other factors, which may be in or out of our control. Moreover, actions or statements that we may take based on based on expectations, assumptions, or third-party information that we currently believe to be reasonable may subsequently be determined to be erroneous or be subject to misinterpretation. Even if this is not the case, our current actions may subsequently be determined to be insufficient by various stakeholders, and we may be subject to investor or regulator engagement on our ESG initiatives and disclosures, even if such initiatives are currently voluntary. \\n\\nCertain market participants, including stockholders and other capital providers, use third-party benchmarks or scores to measure a company’s ESG practices and decide whether to invest in their common stock or engage with them to require changes to their practices. In addition, certain influential institutional investors are also increasing their focus on ESG practices and are placing importance on the implications and social cost of their investments. If our ESG practices do not meet the standards set by these stockholders, they may choose not to invest in our common stock or if our peer companies outperform us in their ESG initiatives, potential or current investors may elect to invest with our competitors instead. Increasing governmental and societal attention to ESG matters, including expanding mandatory and voluntary reporting, diligence and disclosure on topics such as climate change, human capital, labor and risk oversight, could also expand the nature, scope and complexity of matters that we are required to control, assess and report. For example, to the extent ESG matters negatively impact our reputation, it may also impede our ability to compete as effectively to attract and retain employees, customers, or business partners, which may adversely impact our operations. We may be especially subject to scrutiny on such matters given efforts to portray our operations and products as a more sustainable and conscientious alternative to certain competitor products. As another example, the SEC has proposed rules that would require companies to provide significantly expanded climate-related disclosures in their periodic reporting, which may require us to incur significant additional costs to comply, including the implementation of significant additional internal controls processes and procedures regarding matters that have not been subject to such controls in the past, and impose increased oversight obligations on our management \\n\\nand board of directors. These and other regulations, disclosure-related and otherwise, may increase our costs as well as increase scrutiny regarding our ESG efforts, which may enhance the risks discussed in this risk factor. If we do not comply with investor or stockholder expectations and standards in connection with our ESG initiatives, are perceived to have not responded appropriately to address ESG issues within our company, or fail to adapt to or comply with all laws, regulations, policies and related interpretations, our business and reputation could be negatively impacted and our share price and access to/cost of capital could be materially and adversely affected. Additionally, many of our customers and suppliers may be subject to similar expectations, which may augment or create additional risks, including risks that may not be known to us. \\n\\nThe Company is subject to accounting estimate risks. \\n\\nThe preparation of the Company’s consolidated financial statements in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles requires management to make significant estimates that affect the financial statements. Estimates are made at specific points in time and based on facts, historical experience and various other factors believed to be reasonable under the circumstances at such time. If actual results differ from our judgments and assumptions, then it may have an adverse impact on the results of our operations and cash flows. \\n\\nRisks Related to Our Products \\n\\nFood safety and food-borne illness incidents may materially adversely affect our business by exposing us to lawsuits, product recalls or regulatory enforcement actions, increasing our operating costs and reducing demand for our product offerings. \\n\\nSelling food for human consumption involves inherent legal and other risks, and there is increasing governmental scrutiny of and public awareness regarding food safety. Unexpected side effects, illness, injury or death related to allergens, food-borne illnesses or other food safety incidents caused by products we sell, or involving our suppliers or co-manufacturers, could result in the discontinuance of sales of these products or our relationships with such suppliers or co-manufacturers, or otherwise result in increased operating costs, regulatory enforcement actions or harm to our reputation. Shipment of adulterated or misbranded products, even if inadvertent, can result in criminal or civil liability. Such incidents could also expose us to product liability, negligence or other lawsuits, including consumer class action lawsuits. Any claims brought against us may exceed or be outside the scope of our existing or future insurance policy coverage or limits. Any judgment against us that is more than our policy limits or not covered by our policies or not subject to insurance would have to be paid from our cash reserves, which would reduce our capital resources. \\n\\nThe occurrence of food-borne illnesses or other food safety incidents could also adversely affect the price and availability of affected ingredients, resulting in higher costs, disruptions in supply and a reduction in our sales. Furthermore, any instances of food contamination or regulatory noncompliance, whether or not caused by our actions, could compel us, our suppliers, our distributors or our customers, depending on the circumstances, to conduct a recall in accordance with FDA regulations, comparable state laws or foreign laws such as those of the European Union, the United Kingdom and China. Food recalls could result in significant losses due to their costs, the destruction of product inventory, lost sales due to the unavailability of the product for a period of time and potential loss of existing distributors or customers and a potential negative impact on our ability to attract new customers due to negative consumer experiences or because of an adverse impact on our brand and reputation. The costs of a recall could exceed or be outside the scope of our existing or future insurance policy coverage or limits. \\n\\nIn addition, food companies have been subject to targeted, large-scale tampering as well as to opportunistic, individual product tampering, and we, like any food company, could be a target for product tampering. Forms of tampering could include the introduction of foreign material, chemical contaminants and pathological organisms into consumer products as well as product substitution. FDA regulations require companies like us to analyze, prepare and implement mitigation strategies specifically to address tampering (i.e., intentional adulteration) designed to inflict widespread public health harm. If we do not adequately address the possibility, or any actual instance, of intentional adulteration, we could face possible seizure or recall of our \\n\\nproducts and the imposition of civil or criminal sanctions, which could materially adversely affect our business, financial condition and operating results. \\n\\nConsumer preferences for our products are difficult to predict and may change, and, if we are unable to respond quickly to new trends and demands, our business may be adversely affected. \\n\\nOur business is focused on the development, manufacture, marketing and distribution of a line of branded plant-based meat products as alternatives to animal-based protein products. Consumer demand could change based on a number of possible factors, including dietary habits and nutritional values, concerns regarding the health effects of ingredients and shifts in preference for various product attributes. If consumer demand for our products decreased, our business and financial condition would suffer. In addition, sales of plant-based meat or meat-alternative products are subject to evolving consumer preferences that we may not be able to accurately predict or respond to. Consumer trends that we believe favor sales of our products could change based on a number of possible factors, including a shift in preference from plant-based meat to animal-based protein products (including any products produced using new farming methods or technologies which may reduce the adverse environmental and other factors associated with conventional animal-based protein products), increased acceptance for different alternative proteins that are used in our products, economic factors and social trends. A significant shift in consumer demand away from our products could reduce our sales or our market share and the prestige of our brand, which would harm our business and financial condition. \\n\\nAdditionally, lobbyists supporting the meat industry have engaged in marketing campaigns in an attempt to generate negative publicity regarding our products and may continue to do so in the future. Any shift in consumer perception that our products are not healthy as a result of these campaigns could significantly reduce the value of our brand and damage our business. Other types of adverse publicity concerning our business or the plant-based meat industry generally could also harm our brand, reputation and results of operations. The growing use of social and digital media over recent years has amplified the impact of such negative publicity. \\n\\nSales of the Beyond Burger contribute a significant portion of our revenue. A reduction in sales of Beyond Burger would have an adverse effect on our financial condition. \\n\\nBeyond Burger accounted for approximately 50%, 55% and 58% of our gross revenues in 2022, 2021 and 2020, respectively. The Beyond Burger is our flagship product and has historically been the focal point of our development and marketing efforts, and we believe that sales of the Beyond Burger will continue to constitute a significant portion of our revenues, income and cash flow for the foreseeable future. We cannot be certain that we will be able to continue to expand production and distribution of the Beyond Burger, or that customer demand for our other existing and future products will expand to allow such products to represent a larger percentage of our revenue than they do currently. Accordingly, any factor adversely affecting sales of the Beyond Burger could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. \\n\\nFailure to continually innovate and successfully introduce and commercialize new products or successfully improve existing products may adversely affect our ability to continue to grow. \\n\\nA key element of our long-term growth strategy depends on our ability to develop and market new products and improvements to our existing products that meet our standards for quality and appeal to consumer preferences. The success of our innovation and product development efforts is affected by our ability to anticipate changes in consumer preferences, accurately predict taste preferences and purchasing habits of consumers in new geographic markets, the technical capability of our innovation staff in developing and testing product prototypes, including complying with applicable governmental regulations, commercialization and scale-up of new products, and the success of our management and sales and marketing teams in introducing and marketing new products. Our innovation staff members are continuously testing alternative plant-based proteins to the proteins we currently use in our products, as they seek to find additional protein options to our current ingredients that are more easily sourced, and which retain and build upon the quality and appeal of our current product offerings. Failure to develop, commercialize and market new products that appeal to consumers may lead to a decrease in our growth, sales and profitability. \\n\\nAdditionally, the development and introduction of new products requires substantial research, development and marketing expenditures, which we may be unable to recoup if the new products do not gain widespread market acceptance. If we are unsuccessful in meeting our objectives with respect to new or improved products, our business could be harmed. \\n\\nIngredient and packaging costs are volatile and may rise significantly, which may negatively impact the profitability of our business. \\n\\nWe purchase large quantities of raw materials, including ingredients derived from Canadian, European and North American yellow peas, mung beans, sunflower seeds, rice, faba beans, canola oil and coconut oil. In addition, we purchase and use significant quantities of cardboard, film and plastic to package our products. Costs of ingredients and packaging are volatile and can fluctuate due to conditions that are difficult to predict, including global competition for resources, weather conditions, consumer demand and changes in governmental trade and agricultural programs. Volatility in the prices of raw materials and other supplies we purchase could increase our cost of sales and reduce our profitability. Moreover, we may not be able to implement price increases for our products to cover any increased costs, and any price increases we do implement may result in lower sales volumes. If we are not successful in managing our ingredient and packaging costs, if we are unable to increase our prices to cover increased costs or if such price increases reduce our sales volumes, then such increases in costs will adversely affect our business, results of operations and financial condition. \\n\\nRisks Related to Our Industry and Brand \\n\\nWe face intense competition in our market from our competitors, including manufacturers of animal-based meat products and other brands that produce plant-based meat products, and potential competitors and new market entrants and we may lack sufficient financial or other resources to compete successfully. \\n\\nOur future success depends, in large part, on our ability to implement our long-term growth strategy of expanding supply and distribution, improving placement of our products, attracting new consumers to our brand and introducing new products and product extensions, and expanding into new geographic markets. If we fail to implement this growth strategy or if we invest resources in a growth strategy that ultimately proves unsuccessful, our sales and operating results will be adversely affected. Our ability to implement this growth strategy depends, among other things, on our ability to: \\n\\n• manage relationships with various suppliers, co-manufacturers, distributors, customers and other third parties, and expend time and effort to integrate new suppliers, co-manufacturers, distributors and customers into our fulfillment operations; \\n\\n• continue to compete in retail and foodservice channels; \\n\\n• secure placement in the meat case for our products; \\n\\n• increase our brand recognition and expand and maintain brand loyalty; \\n\\n• develop new product lines and extensions; and \\n\\n• expand into new geographic markets. \\n\\nOur ability to implement our long-term growth strategy also depends on our ability to continue to compete in the retail and foodservice channels. We operate in a highly competitive environment. Numerous brands and products compete for limited retailer shelf space, foodservice customers and consumers. In our market, competition is based on, among other things, taste, nutritional profile, ingredients, texture, ease of integration into the consumer diet, low-carbohydrate, low-sugar, high fiber and protein, lack of cholesterol, soy, gluten and GMOs, convenience, price and promotion tactics, brand awareness and loyalty among customers, media spending, product variety and packaging, access to major retailer shelf space and retail locations, access to \\n\\nmajor foodservice outlets and integration into menus, innovation and intellectual property protection on products. \\n\\nIn response to increased competition, as well as the COVID-19 pandemic, we have recently been providing heavier discounting on some of our products. Although these actions are intended to build brand awareness and increase consumer trials of our products, they have had, and may continue to have, a negative impact on our net revenues, gross profit, gross margin and profitability, impacting period-over-period results. \\n\\nWe compete with conventional animal-protein companies such as Cargill, Hormel, JBS, Perdue Foods, Tyson and WH Group, who may have substantially greater financial and other resources than us and whose animal-based products are well-accepted in the marketplace today. They may also have lower operational costs, and as a result may be able to offer conventional animal meat to customers at lower costs than plant-based meat. This could cause us to lower our prices, resulting in lower profitability or, in the alternative, cause us to lose market share if we fail to lower prices. \\n\\nWe also compete with other food brands, including brands affiliated with conventional animal-protein companies and other large food operators, that develop and sell plant-based meat products, including, but not limited to, Alpha Foods, Boca Foods (Kraft Heinz), Lightlife and Field Roast Grain Meat Co. (Maple Leaf Foods), Gardein (Conagra), Hungry Planet, Inc., Impossible Foods, Incogmeato/Morningstar Farms (Kellogg), Moving Mountains, Omn!pork (OmniFoods), Tofurky, Sweet Earth and Awesome Burger (Nestle’ S.A.), Pure Farmland by Smithfield Foods (WH Group), Raised & Rooted (Tyson), Happy Little Plants (Hormel), Sysco’s Simply Plant-Based Meatless Burger, Tattooed Chef, The Not Company and Vegetarian Butcher (Unilever), and with companies which may be more innovative, have more resources and be able to bring new products to market faster and to more quickly exploit and serve niche markets. For example, a number of U.S. and international companies are working on developing lab-grown or “clean meat,” an animal-protein product cultivated from cells taken from animals, which could have a similar appeal to consumers as plant-based meat products. We compete with these competitors for foodservice customers, retailer shelf space and consumers. \\n\\nGenerally, the food industry is dominated by multinational corporations with substantially greater resources and operations than us. We cannot be certain that we will successfully compete with larger competitors that have greater financial, sales and technical resources or with new competitors and market entrants. Conventional food companies may acquire our competitors or launch their own plant-based meat products, and they may be able to use their resources and scale to respond to competitive pressures and changes in consumer preferences by introducing new products, reducing prices or increasing promotional activities, among other things. Retailers also market competitive products under their own private labels, which are generally sold at lower prices and compete with some of our products. Similarly, retailers could change the merchandising of our products and we may be unable to retain the placement of our products in meat cases to effectively compete with animal-protein products. Competitive pressures, new competitors and market entrants or other factors could cause us to lose market share, which may require us to lower prices, increase marketing and advertising expenditures, or increase the use of discounting or promotional campaigns, each of which would adversely affect our margins and could result in a decrease in our operating results and profitability. \\n\\nOur brand and reputation may be diminished due to real or perceived quality or health issues with our products, which could have an adverse effect on our business, reputation, operating results and financial condition. \\n\\nWe believe our consumers rely on us to provide them with high-quality plant-based meat products. Therefore, real or perceived quality or food safety concerns or failures to comply with applicable food regulations and requirements, whether or not ultimately based on fact and whether or not involving us (such as incidents involving our competitors), could cause negative publicity and reduced confidence in our company, brand or products, or the industry as a whole, which could in turn harm our reputation and sales, and could materially adversely affect our business, financial condition and operating results. Although we believe we have a rigorous quality control process, there can be no assurance that our products will always comply with the standards set for our products, and although we strive to keep our products free of pathogenic organisms, they may not be easily detected and cross-contamination can occur. For example, in 2017, before our products were \\n\\nshipped to distributors or customers, we discovered, through our quality control process, that certain of our products manufactured by a former co-manufacturer were contaminated with salmonella. There is no assurance that this health risk will always be preempted by our quality control processes. \\n\\nWe have no control over our products once purchased by consumers. Accordingly, consumers may prepare our products in a manner that is inconsistent with our directions or store our products for long periods of time, which may adversely affect the quality and safety of our products. If consumers do not perceive our products to be safe or of high quality, then the value of our brand would be diminished, and our business, results of operations and financial condition would be adversely affected. \\n\\nAny loss of confidence on the part of consumers in the ingredients used in our products or in the safety and quality of our products would be difficult and costly to overcome. Any such adverse effect could be exacerbated by our position in the market as a purveyor of high-quality plant-based meat products and may significantly reduce our brand value. Issues regarding the safety of any of our products, regardless of the cause, may have a substantial and adverse effect on our brand, reputation and operating results. \\n\\nThe growing use of social and digital media by us, our consumers and third parties increases the speed and extent that information or misinformation and opinions can be shared. Negative publicity about us, our brands or our products on social or digital media could seriously damage our brands and reputation. If we do not maintain the favorable perception of our brands, our sales and profits could be negatively impacted. \\n\\nIf we fail to develop and maintain our brand, our business could suffer. \\n\\nWe have developed a strong and trusted brand that has contributed significantly to the success of our business, and we believe our continued success depends on our ability to maintain and grow the value of the Beyond Meat brand. Maintaining, promoting and positioning our brand and reputation will depend on, among other factors, the success of our plant-based product offerings, food safety, quality assurance, marketing and merchandising efforts, the nutritional benefits provided by our products and our ability to provide a consistent, high-quality customer experience. Any negative publicity, regardless of its accuracy, could materially adversely affect our business, results of operation and reputation. Brand value is based on perceptions of subjective qualities, and any incident that erodes the loyalty of our customers, suppliers or co-manufacturers, including adverse publicity, negative media or a governmental investigation or litigation, could significantly reduce the value of our brand and significantly damage our business. \\n\\nRisks Related to Our International Operations \\n\\nOur international expansion into China and Europe could expose us to substantial business, regulatory, political, financial and economic risks. \\n\\nOur expansion into China and Europe could expose us to substantial risks associated with doing business in China and Europe, such as risks associated with taxation, inflation, environmental regulations, foreign currency exchange rates, the labor market, property and financial regulations, the COVID-19 pandemic or other public health crises, and the outbreak of hostilities or war. Our ability to operate in China and Europe may be adversely affected by changes in, or our failure to comply with, Chinese or European laws and regulations. In addition, we are exposed to risks associated with our workforce in China and the Netherlands, including with respect to changes in employment and labor laws, which could increase our operating costs. The departure of the United Kingdom from the European Union (commonly known as “Brexit”) on January 31, 2020 has created uncertainties affecting business operations in the U.K., EU and a number of other countries, which could increase volatility in exchange rates, market instability, costs and other risks. There is also significant uncertainty about the future relationship between the United States and China with respect to trade policies, treaties, government regulations and tariffs. \\n\\nFluctuations in currency exchange rates could negatively impact our earnings. \\n\\nA portion of our international business is conducted in currencies other than the U.S. dollar, and therefore changes in foreign exchange rates relative to the U.S. dollar have in the past, and may in the future, affect the \\n\\nvalue of our non‑U.S. dollar net assets, revenues and expenses. Although we closely monitor potential exposures as a result of these fluctuations in currencies, and where cost‑justified we adopt strategies that are designed to reduce the impact of these fluctuations on our financial performance, there can be no assurance that we will be successful in managing our foreign exchange risk. Our exposure to currency exchange rate fluctuations will grow if the relative contribution of our operations outside the United States increases. Any material fluctuations in currencies could have a material effect on our financial condition, results of operations and cash flows. \\n\\nOur international operations are subject to the FCPA and we could be adversely affected by violations of the FCPA and similar worldwide anti-corruption laws. \\n\\nThe FCPA and similar worldwide anti-corruption laws generally prohibit companies and their intermediaries from making certain improper payments for the purpose of obtaining or retaining business. The continued expansion of our international operations could increase the risk of violations of these laws in the future. There is no assurance that we will be completely effective in ensuring our compliance with the FCPA or any other applicable anti-corruption laws. If we are not in compliance with the FCPA and other anti-corruption laws, we may be subject to criminal and civil penalties, disgorgement and other sanctions and remedial measures, and legal expenses, which could have an adverse impact on our business, financial condition, results of operations and liquidity. Likewise, any investigation of any potential violations of the FCPA or other anti-corruption laws or trade control laws by the United States could also have an adverse impact on our reputation, our business, results of operations and financial condition. \\n\\nRisks Related to Our Investments \\n\\nOur manufacturing operations in China and Europe require substantial investments, for which we cannot guarantee forecasted returns. \\n\\nIn 2020, we entered into an investment agreement and related factory leasing contract to design and develop manufacturing facilities in the Jiaxing Economic & Technological Development Zone to manufacture plant-based meat products under the Beyond Meat brand in China and in the fourth quarter of 2021, we leased an approximately 12,000 square foot facility in Shanghai, which is used as a local research and development facility to support our local manufacturing operations. In the second quarter of 2020, we acquired our first manufacturing facility in Europe located in Enschede, the Netherlands. Our substantial investment in China and Europe may expose us to substantial risks and, as a result, we may not realize a return on our investment. Unforeseen delays in the operations of our Chinese or European manufacturing facilities may cause us to incur additional expenses. Operating these facilities may require additional capital expenditures and the efforts and attention of our management and other personnel, which will divert resources from our existing business or operations. Although our Chinese and European facilities are fully operational as of December 31, 2022, they may not provide us with all of the operational and financial benefits we expect to receive. These and other risks may result in our not realizing a return on, or losing some or all, of our planned investments in China and Europe, which could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and financial performance. \\n\\nOur ownership of real property is subject to all the risks inherent in an investment in real estate. \\n\\nWe have direct ownership of certain real estate properties. As is the case with any owner of real property, we are subject to potential liabilities, cost and damages arising out of owning, operating, leasing or otherwise having interests in real property. There are risks that a property may have unforeseen environmental or other hazards resulting in unexpected costs. In addition, we may not be able to expand or operate our owned facilities in the manner we desire, which could adversely impact our production and facility utilization. \\n\\nJoint ventures may not operate according to their business plans if our partners fail to fulfill their obligations, which may adversely affect our results of operations and compel us to dedicate additional resources to these joint ventures. \\n\\nThe nature of a joint venture requires us to share control in certain areas with unaffiliated third parties. If our joint venture partner does not fulfill its obligations, the affected joint venture may not be able to operate in \\n\\naccordance with its business plan. Under such a scenario, our results of operations may be adversely affected and we may be compelled to increase the level of our resources devoted to the joint venture. Also, differing views among joint venture participants may result in delayed decisions, or failure to agree on major issues. If such differences caused a joint venture to deviate from its business plan, our results of operations could be adversely affected. \\n\\nRisks Related to Our Intellectual Property, Information Technology, Cybersecurity and Privacy \\n\\nWe may not be able to protect our proprietary technology adequately, which may impact our commercial success. \\n\\nOur commercial success depends in part on our ability to protect our intellectual property and proprietary technologies. We rely on a combination of patent protection, where appropriate and available, copyrights, trade secrets and trademark laws, as well as confidentiality and other contractual restrictions to protect our proprietary technology. However, these legal means afford only limited protection and may not adequately protect our proprietary technology or permit us to gain or keep any competitive advantage. As of December 31, 2022, we had two issued patents in the United States and seven issued patents outside the United States (U.K., Indonesia, Canada, China, Chile, Israel and Australia), two pending patent applications in the United States, eight pending international patent applications and one provisional patent application. \\n\\nWe cannot offer any assurances about which, if any, patents will issue from these applications, the breadth of any such patents, or whether any issued patents will be found invalid and unenforceable or will be threatened by third parties. Any successful opposition to these patents or any other patents owned by or, if applicable in the future, licensed to us could deprive us of rights necessary for the successful commercialization of products that we may develop. Since patent applications in the United States and most other countries are confidential for a period of time after filing (in most cases 18 months after the filing of the priority application), we cannot be certain that we were the first to file on the technologies covered in several of the patent applications related to our technologies or products. Furthermore, a derivation proceeding can be provoked by a third party, or instituted by the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office, or USPTO, to determine who was the first to invent any of the subject matter covered by the patent claims of our applications. \\n\\nPatent law can be highly uncertain and involve complex legal and factual questions for which important principles remain unresolved. In the United States and in many international jurisdictions, policy regarding the breadth of claims allowed in patents can be inconsistent and/or unclear. The U.S. Supreme Court and the Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit have made, and will likely continue to make, changes in how the patent laws of the United States are interpreted. Similarly, international courts and governments have made, and will continue to make, changes in how the patent laws in their respective countries are interpreted. We cannot predict future changes in the interpretation of patent laws by U.S. and international judicial bodies or changes to patent laws that might be enacted into law by U.S. and international legislative bodies. \\n\\nWe may not be able to protect our intellectual property adequately, which may harm the value of our brand. \\n\\nWe believe that our intellectual property has substantial value and has contributed significantly to the success of our business. Our trademarks, including Beyond Meat, Beyond Burger, Beyond Beef, Beyond Sausage, Beyond Breakfast Sausage, Beyond Chicken, Beyond Steak, Beyond Fried Chicken, Beyond Popcorn Chicken, Beyond Meatballs, the Caped Steer Logo, Go Beyond, Eat What You Love, Cookout Classic and The Future of Protein, are valuable assets that reinforce our brand and consumers’ favorable perception of our products. We also rely on unpatented proprietary expertise, recipes and formulations and other trade secrets and copyright protection to develop and maintain our competitive position. Our continued success depends, to a significant degree, upon our ability to protect and preserve our intellectual property, including our trademarks, trade dress, trade secrets and copyrights. We rely on confidentiality agreements and trademark, trade secret and copyright law to protect our intellectual property rights. \\n\\nOur confidentiality agreements with our employees and certain of our consultants, contract workers, suppliers and independent contractors, including some of our co-manufacturers who use our formulations to manufacture our products, generally require that all information made known to them be kept strictly confidential. Nevertheless, trade secrets are difficult to protect. Although we attempt to protect our trade secrets, our confidentiality agreements may not effectively prevent disclosure of our proprietary information and may not provide an adequate remedy in the event of unauthorized disclosure of such information. If we do not keep our trade secrets confidential, others may produce products with our recipes or formulations. In addition, others may independently discover our trade secrets, in which case we would not be able to assert trade secret rights against such parties. Further, some of our formulations have been developed by or with our suppliers and co-manufacturers. As a result, we may not be able to prevent others from using similar formulations. As we begin to expand globally as part of our long-term growth strategy, we may face additional risks protecting our trade secrets internationally, where the laws may not be as protective of intellectual property rights as those in the United States. \\n\\nWe cannot assure you that the steps we have taken to protect our intellectual property rights are adequate, that our intellectual property rights can be successfully defended and asserted in the future or that third parties will not infringe upon or misappropriate any such rights. In addition, our trademark rights and related registrations may be challenged in the future and could be canceled or narrowed. Failure to protect our trademark rights could prevent us in the future from challenging third parties who use names and logos similar to our trademarks, which may in turn cause consumer confusion or negatively affect consumers’ perception of our brand and products. Moreover, intellectual property disputes and proceedings and infringement claims may result in a significant distraction for management and significant expense, which may not be recoverable regardless of whether we are successful. Such proceedings may be protracted with no certainty of success, and an adverse outcome could subject us to liabilities, force us to cease use of certain trademarks or other intellectual property or force us to enter into licenses with others. Any one of these occurrences may have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition. \\n\\nAdditionally, the laws of certain international jurisdictions in which our products may be sold may not protect intellectual property rights to the same extent as the laws of the United States. As a result, we may not be able to effectively prevent third parties from infringing or otherwise misappropriating our trademark rights in such jurisdictions. Moreover, failure to obtain adequate trademark rights in these foreign jurisdictions could negatively impact our ability to expand our business and launch products in certain international markets. Further, we may not be able to effectively protect our intellectual property rights against unauthorized third parties that obtain the rights to our trademarks in foreign jurisdictions where we have not yet applied for trademark protections, and we may expend substantial cost to obtain those trademarks from such third parties. Any one of these occurrences could reduce our competitive position or otherwise have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition. \\n\\nWe rely on information technology systems and any inadequacy, failure, interruption or security breaches of those systems may harm our ability to effectively operate our business. \\n\\nWe are dependent on various information technology systems, including, but not limited to, networks, applications and outsourced services in connection with the operation of our business. A failure of our information technology systems to perform as we anticipate could disrupt our business and result in transaction errors, processing inefficiencies and loss of sales, causing our business to suffer. In addition, our information technology systems may be vulnerable to damage or interruption from circumstances beyond our control, including fire, severe weather, natural disasters, systems failures, viruses and security breaches, particularly in light of many of our employees working remotely. Any such damage or interruption could have a material adverse effect on our business. \\n\\nA cybersecurity incident, other technology disruptions or failure to comply with laws and regulations relating to privacy and the protection of data relating to individuals could negatively impact our business, our reputation and our relationships with customers. \\n\\nWe use computers in substantially all aspects of our business operations. We also use mobile devices, social networking and other online activities to connect with our employees, suppliers, co-manufacturers, distributors, customers and consumers. Such uses give rise to cybersecurity risks, including security breaches, espionage, system disruption, theft and inadvertent release of information. Our business involves the storage and transmission of numerous classes of sensitive and/or confidential information and intellectual property, including customers’ and suppliers’ information, private information about employees and financial and strategic information about us and our business partners. Further, as we pursue new initiatives that improve our operations and cost structure, potentially including acquisitions, we may also expand and improve our information technologies, resulting in a larger technological presence and corresponding exposure to cybersecurity risk. If we fail to assess and identify cybersecurity risks associated with new initiatives or acquisitions, we may become increasingly vulnerable to such risks. Additionally, while we have implemented measures to prevent security breaches and cyber incidents, our preventative measures and incident response efforts may not be entirely effective. The theft, destruction, loss, misappropriation, or release of sensitive and/or confidential information or intellectual property, or interference with our information technology systems or the technology systems of third parties on which we rely, could result in business disruption, negative publicity, brand damage, violation of privacy laws, loss of customers, potential liability and competitive disadvantage all of which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition or results of operations. \\n\\nIn addition, we are subject to laws, rules and regulations in the United States, the European Union, China and other jurisdictions relating to the collection, use and security of personal information and data. Such data privacy laws, regulations and other obligations may require us to change our business practices and may negatively impact our ability to expand our business and pursue business opportunities. We may incur significant expenses to comply with the laws, regulations and other obligations that apply to us. Additionally, the privacy and data protection-related laws, rules and regulations applicable to us are subject to significant change. Several jurisdictions have passed new laws and regulations in this area, and other jurisdictions are considering imposing additional restrictions. For example, our operations are subject to the European Union’s General Data Protection Regulation, which imposes data privacy and security requirements on companies doing business in the European Union, including substantial penalties for non-compliance. The California Consumer Privacy Act (the “CCPA”), which went into effect on January 1, 2020, imposes similar requirements on companies handling data of California residents and creates a new and potentially severe statutory damages framework for (i) violations of the CCPA and (ii) businesses that fail to implement reasonable security procedures and practices to prevent data breaches. The California Privacy Rights Act, which became effective January 1, 2023, amends and expands the CCPA, including by expanding consumer’s rights in their personal information and creating a new governmental agency to interpret and enforce the statute. Additionally, in August 2021, the National People’s Congress of the People's Republic of China adopted the Personal Information Protection Law, which became effective on November 1, 2021 and provides a comprehensive system for the protection of personal information in China. Privacy and data protection-related laws and regulations also may be interpreted and enforced inconsistently over time and from jurisdiction to jurisdiction. Any actual or perceived inability to comply with applicable privacy or data protection laws, regulations, or other obligations could result in significant cost and liability, litigation or governmental investigations, damage our reputation, and adversely affect our business. \\n\\nRisks Related to Our Lease Obligations, Indebtedness, Financial Position and Need for Additional Capital \\n\\nIf the build out of our new Campus Headquarters is delayed or incurs cost overruns, the headquarters does not operate in accordance with our expectations or occupancy rates are lower than anticipated, our business or financial condition or results of operations may be adversely affected. \\n\\nOn January 14, 2021, we entered into a lease agreement for an initial term of 12 years to develop and house our new Campus Headquarters. The space is being built out by the landlord, who delivered Phase 1-A of the space, which we currently occupy, to us in the third quarter of 2022. We expect the landlord to deliver to us the remainder of the space by the end of 2023; however, there can be no assurances that the remainder of the space will be ready for occupancy on or before the expected occupancy date due to force majeure events (such as COVID-19) or the risk of delays or cost overruns inherent in construction development projects, any of which could have a negative impact on our financial condition or results of operations. If we are not able to complete development of the Campus Headquarters within the approved budget or there are significant cost overruns, our cash flows, financial condition, or results of operations could be materially and adversely affected. \\n\\nIn addition, it is possible that, once finalized, there could be unanticipated difficulties in initiating operations at the Campus Headquarters, including, but not limited to, IT system interruptions, other infrastructure support problems or the space may prove to be less conducive to our operations than currently anticipated. These risks could all result in operational inefficiencies or similar difficulties that could prove difficult or impossible to remediate and have an adverse impact on our financial condition or results of operations. Moreover, we are uncertain about how the long-term impacts of COVID-19 (for example, a shift in the percentage of our workforce that works remotely) will affect our ability to timely fully occupy the Campus Headquarters once construction is complete, which could have a negative impact on our financial condition or results of operations. \\n\\nIf we are unable to occupy the Campus Headquarters space, we may have to sublease the unoccupied portion of the Campus Headquarters. A sublease agreement would be subject to certain risks and uncertainties, such as the possibility that such agreement may not be completed on terms that are advantageous to us as we may not receive sufficiently high rental rates to cover our lease obligations which could have a negative impact on our financial condition and results of operations. \\n\\nWe currently have, and will continue to have, significant lease obligations, and our failure to meet those obligations could adversely affect our financial condition and business. \\n\\nWe currently have, and will continue to have, significant lease obligations for our corporate offices, manufacturing facilities, research and development facilities and warehouses. We depend on cash flow from operations to pay our lease expenses. \\n\\nIf our business does not generate sufficient cash flow from operating activities to fund these expenses, we may not be able to meet our lease obligations, which could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and business. Furthermore, the significant cash flow required to satisfy our financial obligations under the leases could limit our ability to incur indebtedness and make capital expenditures or other investments in our business. \\n\\nOur significant indebtedness and liabilities could limit the cash flow available for our operations, expose us to risks that could adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations and impair our ability to satisfy our obligations under our Notes. \\n\\nAs of December 31, 2022, we had approximately $1.3 billion of consolidated indebtedness and other liabilities. We may also incur additional indebtedness to meet future financing needs. Our indebtedness could have significant negative consequences for our security holders and our business, results of operations and financial condition by, among other things: \\n\\n• increasing our vulnerability to adverse economic and industry conditions; \\n\\n• limiting our ability to obtain additional financing; \\n\\n• requiring the dedication of a substantial portion of our cash flow from operations to service our indebtedness, which will reduce the amount of cash available for other purposes; \\n\\n• limiting our flexibility to plan for, or react to, changes in our business; \\n\\n• diluting the interests of our existing stockholders as a result of issuing shares of our common stock upon conversion of the Notes; and \\n\\n• placing us at a possible competitive disadvantage with competitors that are less leveraged than us or have better access to capital. \\n\\nIn March 2021, we issued $1.0 billion aggregate principal amount of our 0% Convertible Senior Notes due 2027 (the “Convertible Notes”) in a private placement to qualified institutional buyers pursuant to Rule 144A under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended (the “Securities Act”). The initial purchasers of the Convertible Notes also exercised their option to purchase an additional $150.0 million aggregate principal amount of our 0% Convertible Senior Notes due 2027 (the “Additional Notes,” and together with the Convertible Notes, the “Notes”), and such Additional Notes were issued on March 16, 2021. \\n\\nOur ability to make scheduled payments of the principal of, to pay interest on or to refinance our current or future indebtedness, including the Notes, as applicable, depends on our future performance, which is subject to economic, financial, competitive and other factors beyond our control. Our business may not generate sufficient funds, and we may otherwise be unable to maintain sufficient cash reserves, to pay amounts due under our current or future indebtedness, including the Notes, and our cash needs may increase in the future. In addition, any future indebtedness that we may incur may contain financial and other restrictive covenants that limit our ability to operate our business, raise capital or make payments under our other indebtedness. If we fail to comply with these covenants or to make payments under our indebtedness when due, then we would be in default under that indebtedness, which could, in turn, result in that and our other indebtedness becoming immediately payable in full. \\n\\nWe may be unable to raise the funds necessary to repurchase the Notes for cash following a fundamental change, or to pay the cash amounts due upon conversion, and our future indebtedness may limit our ability to repurchase the Notes or pay cash upon their conversion. \\n\\nHolders of the Notes may, subject to a limited exception, require us to repurchase their Notes following a “Fundamental Change” (as defined in the Indenture) at a cash repurchase price generally equal to the principal amount of the Notes to be repurchased, plus accrued and unpaid special and additional interest, if any. In addition, all conversions of Notes will be settled partially or entirely in cash. We may not have enough available cash or be able to obtain financing at the time we are required to repurchase the Notes or pay the cash amounts due upon conversion. In addition, applicable law, regulatory authorities and the agreements governing our future indebtedness may restrict our ability to repurchase the Notes or pay the cash amounts due upon conversion. Our failure to repurchase the Notes or to pay the cash amounts due upon conversion when required will constitute a default under the Indenture. A default under the Indenture or the Fundamental Change itself could also lead to a default under agreements governing our future indebtedness, which may result in that indebtedness becoming immediately payable in full. If the repayment of such future indebtedness were to be accelerated after any applicable notice or grace periods, then we may not have sufficient funds to repay that indebtedness and repurchase the Notes or make cash payments upon their conversion. \\n\\nThe accounting method for the Notes could adversely affect our reported financial condition and results. \\n\\nOur Notes do not bear regular interest, and the principal amount of the Notes do not accrete. However, special interest and additional interest may accrue on the Notes at a rate per annum not exceeding 0.50% (subject to certain exceptions) upon the occurrence of certain events relating to the failure to file certain SEC reports or to remove certain restrictive legends from the Notes. The accounting method for reflecting the Notes \\n\\non our balance sheet may adversely affect our reported earnings and financial condition. If any of the conditions to the convertibility of the Notes is satisfied or the Notes become due within one year, then we may be required under applicable accounting standards to reclassify the liability carrying value of the Notes as a current, rather than a long-term, liability. This reclassification could be required even if no noteholders convert their Notes and could materially reduce our reported working capital. \\n\\nWe early adopted Accounting Standards Update (“ASU”) No. 2020-06, “Debt with Conversion and Other Options (Subtopic 470-20) and Derivatives and Hedging—Contracts in Entity's Own Equity” (“ASU 2020-06”), to account for our Notes which eliminates the treasury stock method for convertible instruments that can be settled in whole or in part with equity and instead requires the application of the more dilutive of the “if-converted” method or the two-class method. Under the if-converted method, diluted earnings per share would generally be calculated assuming that all the conversion premium or spread were converted at the beginning of the reporting period, unless the result would be anti-dilutive. The conversion premium or spread would have a dilutive impact on net income per share when the average market price of the Company’s common stock for a given period exceeds the conversion price. \\n\\nThe capped call transactions may affect the value of the Notes and our common stock. \\n\\nIn connection with the Notes, we entered into privately negotiated capped call transactions with the option counterparties. The capped call transactions will cover, subject to customary adjustments, the number of shares of common stock that underlie the Notes. The capped call transactions are expected generally to reduce potential dilution to our common stock upon conversion of the Notes or at our election (subject to certain conditions) offset any cash payments we are required to make in excess of the aggregate principal amount of the converted Notes, as the case may be, with such reduction or offset subject to a cap. \\n\\nWe have been advised that, in connection with establishing their initial hedges of the capped call transactions, the option counterparties or their respective affiliates purchased shares of our common stock and/or entered into various derivative transactions with respect to our common stock. \\n\\nIn addition, we have been advised that the option counterparties or their respective affiliates may modify their hedge positions by entering into or unwinding various derivatives with respect to our common stock and/or purchasing or selling our common stock or other securities of ours in secondary market transactions following the pricing of the Notes and prior to the maturity of the Notes (and are likely to do so on each exercise date of the capped call transactions, and in connection with any early termination event in respect of the capped call transactions). This activity could also cause or avoid an increase or a decrease in the market price of our common stock. \\n\\nProvisions in the indenture governing the Notes could delay or prevent an otherwise beneficial takeover of us. \\n\\nCertain provisions in the Notes and the indenture governing the Notes could make a third party attempt to acquire us more difficult or expensive. For example, if a takeover constitutes a fundamental change, then noteholders will have the right to require us to repurchase their Notes for cash. In addition, if a takeover constitutes a Make-Whole Fundamental Change (as defined in the Indenture), then we may be required to temporarily increase the conversion rate. In either case, and in other cases, our obligations under the Notes and the indenture governing the Notes could increase the cost of acquiring us or otherwise discourage a third party from acquiring us or removing incumbent management, including in a transaction that holders of our common stock or Notes may view as favorable. \\n\\nWe may require additional financing to achieve our goals, and a failure to obtain this necessary capital when needed on acceptable terms, or at all, may force us to delay, limit, reduce or terminate our product manufacturing and development, and other operations. \\n\\nSince our inception, substantially all of our resources have been dedicated to the development of our three core plant-based product platforms of beef, pork and poultry, including purchases of property, plant and \\n\\nequipment, principally to support the development and production of our products, the build-out and equipping of our former Manhattan Beach Project Innovation Center and our Innovation Center within our Campus Headquarters, and the purchase, build-out and equipping of manufacturing facilities in the U.S. and abroad. We have and believe that we will continue to expend resources as we expand into additional markets we may choose to pursue. These expenditures are expected to include costs associated with research and development, manufacturing and supply, as well as marketing and selling existing and new products. In addition, other unanticipated costs may arise. \\n\\nAs of December 31, 2022, we had cash and cash equivalents and restricted cash of $322.5 million. Our operating plan may change because of factors currently unknown to us, and we may need to seek additional funds sooner than planned, through public or private equity or debt financings or other sources, including strategic collaborations. Such financing may result in dilution to stockholders, reduction in the market price of our common stock, imposition of debt covenants and repayment obligations, or other restrictions that may adversely affect our business. In addition, we may seek additional capital due to favorable market conditions or strategic considerations even if we believe we have sufficient funds for our current or future operating plans. However, the capital markets may experience extreme volatility and disruption, including rising interest rates and higher borrowing costs, which could make it more difficult for us to raise capital. If we cannot access the capital markets upon favorable terms or at all, it may impact our ability to achieve our goals. \\n\\nOur future capital requirements depend on many factors, including: \\n\\n• the number and characteristics of any additional products or manufacturing processes we develop or acquire to serve new or existing markets; \\n\\n• our investment in and build out of our Campus Headquarters; \\n\\n• the expenses associated with our marketing initiatives; \\n\\n• our investment in manufacturing and facilities to expand our manufacturing and production capacity; \\n\\n• our investments in real property and joint ventures; \\n\\n• the costs required to fund domestic and international operations and growth; \\n\\n• the scope, progress, results and costs of researching and developing future products or improvements to existing products or manufacturing processes; \\n\\n• any lawsuits related to our products or commenced against us or our directors and officers; \\n\\n• the expenses needed to attract and retain skilled personnel; \\n\\n• the costs associated with being a public company; \\n\\n• the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic, or any other pandemic, epidemic or other public health crisis; \\n\\n• the costs involved in preparing, filing, prosecuting, maintaining, defending and enforcing intellectual property claims, including litigation costs and the outcome of such litigation; and \\n\\n• the timing, receipt and amount of sales of, or royalties on, any future approved products, if any. \\n\\nAdditional funds may not be available when we need them, on terms that are acceptable to us, or at all. If adequate funds are not available to us on a timely basis, we may be required to: \\n\\n• delay, limit, reduce or terminate our manufacturing, research and development activities or our growth and expansion plans; or \\n\\n• delay, limit, reduce or terminate our establishment of sales and marketing capabilities or other activities that may be necessary to generate revenue and achieve profitability. \\n\\nOur inability to access and employ the cash that collateralizes our outstanding and future letters of credit may impact our liquidity. \\n\\nAs of December 31, 2022, we had restricted cash of $12.6 million securing the letter of credit to support the development and leasing of our Campus Headquarters. Our inability to access and employ the cash that collateralizes our outstanding and future letters of credit may impact our liquidity and could have an adverse impact on our business, operations and financial condition. \\n\\nRisks Related to the Environment, Climate and Weather \\n\\nA major earthquake, tsunami, tornado, wildfire, flood, drought or other natural disaster or severe weather event could seriously disrupt our entire business. \\n\\nWe have offices, co-manufacturing and manufacturing facilities located in the United States and internationally. The impact of a major earthquake, tsunami, tornado, flood, wildfire, drought or other natural disaster or severe weather event at any of our facilities and overall operations is difficult to predict, but such a natural disaster or severe weather event could seriously disrupt our entire business and lead to substantial losses, which may not be covered by insurance. Additionally, to the extent such events become more frequent or intense, such as a result of climate change, it may adversely impact the cost or availability of such insurance. \\n\\nClimate change may negatively affect our business and operations. \\n\\nIncreasing concentrations of greenhouse gases in the atmosphere have generally been concluded to lead to increased ambient global temperatures, as well as changes in weather patterns and the frequency and severity of extreme weather and natural disasters. Adverse climate conditions, weather patterns and the impact of such conditions and patterns such as drought, flood, wildfires, mudslides and rising ambient temperatures adversely impact product cultivation conditions for farmers and agricultural productivity, including by disrupting ecosystems and severely altering the growing conditions, nutrient levels, soil moisture and water availability necessary for the growth and cultivation of crops, which would adversely affect the product quality, availability or cost of certain commodities that are necessary for our products, such as yellow peas, mung beans, sunflowers, rice, faba bean, canola oil and coconut oil. Many of our operations exist in water-stressed regions and water is a key ingredient in our products. Due to climate change, we may also be subjected to decreased availability of water, deteriorated quality of water or less favorable pricing for water, which could adversely impact our manufacturing and distribution operations. These and other changes to the physical environment may adversely impact our operations or those of the suppliers on whom we rely. While we may take various actions to mitigate our business risks associated with climate change, this may require us to incur substantial costs and may not be successful, due to, among other things, the uncertainty associated with the longer-term projections associated with managing climate risks. \\n\\nRisks Related to Being a Public Company \\n\\nIf we fail to maintain proper and effective internal controls, our ability to produce accurate financial statements on a timely basis could be impaired, investors may lose confidence in our financial reporting and the trading price of our common stock may decline. \\n\\nEnsuring that we have adequate internal financial and accounting controls and procedures in place to produce accurate financial statements on a timely basis is a costly and time-consuming effort that needs to be re-evaluated frequently. We are in the process of upgrading our information technology systems and implementing additional financial and management controls, reporting systems and procedures in order to keep up with the requirements of being a reporting company under the Exchange Act. Additionally, the growth of our operations and our being a public company have created a need for additional resources within the accounting and finance functions due to the increasing need to produce timely financial information and to ensure the level of segregation of duties customary for a U.S. public company. We have hired additional resources in the accounting and finance functions and continue to reassess the sufficiency of finance personnel in response to these increasing demands and expectations. \\n\\nAs a public company, we are required to document and test our internal control over financial reporting pursuant to Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act so that our management can certify as to the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting. The rules governing the standards that must be met for management to assess our internal control over financial reporting are complex and require significant documentation, testing and possible remediation. We have and will continue to expend significant resources in developing the necessary documentation and testing procedures required by Section 404. We cannot be certain that the actions we have and will continue to take to improve our internal controls over financial reporting will be sufficient. \\n\\nAny failure to maintain internal control over financial reporting could severely inhibit our ability to accurately report our financial condition, results of operations or cash flows. If we are unable to conclude that our internal control over financial reporting is effective, or if our independent registered public accounting firm determines we have a material weakness or significant deficiency in our internal control over financial reporting, investors may lose confidence in the accuracy and completeness of our financial reports, the market price of our common stock could decline, and we could be subject to sanctions or investigations by NASDAQ, the SEC or other regulatory authorities. Failure to remedy any material weakness in our internal control over financial reporting, or to implement or maintain other effective control systems required of public companies, could also restrict our future access to the capital markets. \\n\\nOur disclosure controls and procedures may not prevent or detect all errors or acts of fraud. \\n\\nOur disclosure controls and procedures are designed to reasonably assure that information required to be disclosed by us in reports we file or submit under the Exchange Act is accumulated and communicated to management, recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time periods specified in the rules and forms of the SEC. We believe that any disclosure controls and procedures or internal controls and procedures, no matter how well conceived and operated, can provide only reasonable, not absolute, assurance that the objectives of the control system are met. \\n\\nThese inherent limitations include the realities that judgments in decision-making can be faulty, and that breakdowns can occur because of simple error or mistake. Additionally, controls can be circumvented by the individual acts of some persons, by collusion of two or more people or by an unauthorized override of the controls. Accordingly, because of the inherent limitations in our control system, misstatements or insufficient disclosures due to error or fraud may occur and not be detected. \\n\\nThe requirements of being a public company will require us to incur increased costs and may strain our resources, divert management’s attention and affect our ability to attract and retain qualified board members. \\n\\nAs a public company, we have incurred and will continue to incur significant legal, accounting and other expenses that we did not incur as a private company. We are subject to the reporting requirements of the Exchange Act which requires, among other things, that we file with the SEC annual, quarterly and current reports with respect to our business and financial condition. In addition, the Sarbanes-Oxley Act, as well as related rules adopted by the SEC and the Nasdaq Global Select Market, impose significant requirements on public companies, including requiring establishment and maintenance of effective disclosure and financial controls and changes in corporate governance practices. Further, we are required to comply with certain requirements of the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act, or the Dodd-Frank Act, as well as rules and regulations subsequently implemented by the SEC related to corporate governance and executive compensation, such as “say on pay” and proxy access. As such, we have and will continue to incur additional compliance-related expenses. Additionally, the SEC and other regulators have continued to adopt new rules and regulations and make additional changes to existing regulations that require our compliance. \\n\\nStockholder activism, the current political environment and the current high level of government intervention and regulatory reform may lead to substantial new regulations and disclosure obligations, which may lead to additional compliance costs and impact, in ways we cannot currently anticipate, the manner in which we operate our business. We expect the rules and regulations applicable to public companies to continue to increase our \\n\\nlegal and financial compliance costs and to make some activities more time-consuming and costly. If these requirements divert the attention of our management and personnel from other business concerns, they could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. The increased costs will decrease our net income or increase our net loss and may require us to reduce costs in other areas of our business. Furthermore, these rules and regulations could make it more difficult or more costly for us to obtain certain types of insurance, including director and officer liability insurance, and we may be forced to accept reduced policy limits and coverage and higher self-insured retention amounts, or incur substantially higher costs to obtain the same or similar coverage. The impact of these requirements could also make it more difficult for us to attract and retain qualified persons to serve on our board of directors, our board committees or as executive officers. We cannot predict or estimate the amount or timing of additional costs we may incur to respond to these requirements. \\n\\nRisks Related to Regulatory and Legal Compliance Matters, Litigation and Legal Proceedings \\n\\nOur operations are subject to FDA governmental regulation and other foreign, federal, state and local regulation, and there is no assurance that we will be in compliance with all regulations. \\n\\nOur operations are subject to extensive regulation by the FDA, and other foreign, federal, state and local authorities. Specifically, for products manufactured or sold in the United States we are subject to the requirements of the Federal Food, Drug and Cosmetic Act and regulations promulgated thereunder by the FDA. \\n\\nThis comprehensive regulatory program governs, among other things, the manufacturing, composition and ingredients, packaging, labeling and safety of food. Under this program, the FDA requires that facilities that manufacture food products comply with a range of requirements, including hazard analysis and preventive controls regulations, current good manufacturing practices (“cGMPs”), and supplier verification requirements. Comparable regulations apply in foreign jurisdictions such as the European Union, the United Kingdom and China. Our processing and manufacturing facilities, including those of our co-manufacturers, are subject to periodic inspection by foreign, federal, state and local authorities. We do not control the manufacturing processes of, and rely upon, our co-manufacturers for compliance with cGMPs for the manufacturing of our products by our co-manufacturers. If we or our co-manufacturers cannot successfully manufacture products that conform to our specifications and the strict regulatory requirements of the FDA or other non-U.S. regulators, we or they may be subject to adverse inspectional findings or enforcement actions, which could materially impact our ability to market our products, could result in our inability to manufacture our products or our co-manufacturers’ inability to continue manufacturing for us, or could result in a recall of our product that has already been distributed. In addition, we rely upon our co-manufacturers to maintain adequate quality control, quality assurance and qualified personnel. If the FDA or a comparable state, local or foreign regulatory authority determines that we or these co-manufacturers have not complied with the applicable regulatory requirements, our business may be materially impacted. \\n\\nWe seek to comply with applicable regulations through a combination of employing internal experience and expert personnel to ensure quality-assurance compliance (i.e., assuring that our products are not adulterated or misbranded) and contracting with third-party laboratories that conduct analyses of products to ensure compliance with nutrition labeling requirements and to identify any potential contaminants before distribution. Failure by us or our co-manufacturers to comply with applicable laws and regulations or maintain permits, licenses or registrations relating to our or our co-manufacturers’ operations could subject us to civil remedies or penalties, including fines, injunctions, recalls or seizures, warning letters, restrictions or prohibitions on the marketing or manufacturing of products, or refusals to permit the import or export of products, as well as potential criminal sanctions, which could result in increased operating costs resulting in a material effect on our operating results and business. \\n\\nWe are subject to international regulations that could adversely affect our business and results of operations. \\n\\nWe are subject to extensive regulations internationally where we manufacture, distribute and/or sell our products. Our products are subject to numerous food safety and other laws and regulations relating to the \\n\\nsourcing, manufacturing, composition and ingredients, storing, labeling, marketing, advertising and distribution of these products. For example, in early 2018, we received an inquiry from Canadian officials about the labeling and composition of products that we export to Canada. We responded promptly to that inquiry, identifying minor formulation changes that we made under Canadian regulations. If regulators determine that the labeling, advertising and/or composition of any of our products is not in compliance with foreign law or regulations, or if we or our co-manufacturers otherwise fail to comply with applicable laws and regulations in foreign jurisdictions where we operate and market products, we could be subject to civil remedies or penalties, such as fines, injunctions, recalls or seizures, warning letters, restrictions on the marketing or manufacturing of the products, or refusals to permit the import or export of products, as well as potential criminal sanctions. In places like Mainland China, government inquiries into product labeling and advertising can be prompted by random inspections of our product on the market by local government authorities or complaints by consumers or competitors to the authorities. The consequences of a labeling or advertising violation in China can lead not only to fines from administrative authorities but also to multiple individual consumer lawsuits for nominal damages in the hundreds of dollars each, which can be costly to defend. In addition, enforcement of existing laws and regulations, changes in legal requirements and/or evolving interpretations of existing regulatory requirements may result in increased compliance costs and create other obligations, financial or otherwise, that could adversely affect our business, financial condition or operating results. For example, China has recently introduced new regulations on food manufacturing and it may introduce new Food Labeling Supervision Measures that could increase restrictions and require changes to our labels. In addition, with our expanding international operations, we could be adversely affected by violations of the FCPA, and similar worldwide anti-bribery laws, which generally prohibit companies and their intermediaries from making improper payments to non-U.S. officials or other third parties for the purpose of obtaining or retaining business. While our policies mandate compliance with these anti-bribery laws, our internal control policies and procedures may not protect us from reckless or criminal acts committed by our employees, contractors or agents. Violations of these laws, or allegations of such violations, could disrupt our business and result in a material adverse effect on our results of operations, cash flows and financial condition. \\n\\nAny changes in, or changes in the interpretation of, applicable laws, regulations or policies of the FDA or U.S. Department of Agriculture, or USDA, state regulators or similar foreign regulatory authorities that relate to the use of the word “meat” or other similar words in connection with plant-based meat products could adversely affect our business, prospects, results of operations or financial condition. \\n\\nThe FDA and the USDA, state regulators or similar foreign regulatory authorities, such as Health Canada or the CFIA, or authorities of the U.K., the EU or the EU member states, or China, including the State Administration for Market Regulation and its local counterpart agencies, could take action to impact our ability to use the term “meat” or similar words (such as “beef,” “burger” or “sausage,” including the Beyond Meat logo of the Caped Longhorn superhero) to describe or advertise our products. In addition, a food may be deemed misbranded if its labeling is false or misleading in any particular way, and the FDA, CFIA, EU member state authorities or other regulators could interpret the use of the term “meat” or any similar phrase(s) to describe our plant-based meat products as false or misleading or likely to create an erroneous impression regarding their composition. \\n\\nFor example, in 2018, the state of Missouri passed a law prohibiting any person engaged in advertising, offering for sale, or sale of food products from misrepresenting a product as meat that is not derived from harvested production livestock or poultry. The state of Missouri Department of Agriculture has clarified its interpretation that products which include prominent disclosure that the product is “made from plants,” or comparable disclosure such as through the use of the phrase “plant-based,” are not misrepresented under the Missouri law. Additional states, including Arkansas, Georgia, Mississippi, Louisiana, Oklahoma, South Dakota and Wyoming, have subsequently passed similar laws, and legislation that would impose specific requirements on the naming of plant-based meat products is currently pending in a number of other states. The United States Congress recently considered (but did not pass) federal legislation, called the Real MEAT Act, that could require changes to our product labeling and marketing, including identifying products as “imitation” meat products, and that would give USDA certain oversight over the labeling of plant-based meat products. If similar bills gain traction and ultimately become law, we could be required to identify our products as “imitation” in our product \\n\\nlabels. Further, the FDA has announced that it is developing guidance on naming plant-based meat alternatives that could impact our naming expectations. Canadian Food and Drug Regulations also provide requirements for “simulated meat” products, including requirements around composition and naming. \\n\\nIn Europe, the Agriculture Committee of the European Parliament proposed in May 2019 to reserve the use of “meat” and meat-related terms and names for products that are manufactured from the edible parts of animals. In October 2020, the European Parliament rejected the adoption of this provision. In the absence of European Union legislation, Member States remain free to establish national restrictions on meat-related names. In June 2020, France adopted a law prohibiting names to indicate foodstuffs of animal origin to describe, market, or promote foodstuffs containing vegetable proteins. In October 2021, France published a draft implementing decree to define, for example, the sanctions in case of non-compliance with the new law. The Decree was published on June 29, 2022, and entered into force on October 1, 2022. We do not believe that the Decree complies with the laws of the European Union (EU), in particular the principle of free movement of goods. On July 27, 2022, at the request of a trade association, the French High Administrative Court partially suspended the execution of the Decree. This signals that there are indeed serious doubts as to the lawfulness of the Decree, though the suspension is only partial and temporary until the Court rules on the merits of the case. We understand that at least two more trade associations are also considering litigation. In this context, on October 21, 2022, the Company filed an application for annulment against the Decree. The Company also intervened in favor of the trade association in their pending case against the Decree on November 16, 2022. \\n\\nFrance is the first EU Member State to adopt such a law. Should other EU Member State regulatory authorities take action with respect to the use of the term “meat” or similar claims, such that we are unable to use those terms with respect to our plant-based products, we could be subject to enforcement action or recall of our products marketed with these terms, we may be required to modify our marketing strategy, or required to identify our products as “imitation” in our product labels, and our business, prospects, results of operations or financial condition could be adversely affected. \\n\\nIncreases in income tax rates or changes in income tax laws could have a material adverse impact on our financial results. \\n\\nIncreases in income tax rates or other changes in tax laws, including changes in how existing tax laws are interpreted or enforced, could adversely affect our financial performance. The increasingly complex global tax environment has in the past and could continue to increase tax uncertainty, resulting in higher compliance costs and adverse effects on our financial performance. We are also subject to regular reviews, examinations and audits by numerous taxing authorities with respect to income and non-income based taxes. Economic and political pressures to increase tax revenues in jurisdictions in which we operate, or the adoption of new or reformed tax legislation or regulation, may make resolving tax disputes more difficult and the final resolution of tax audits and any related litigation can differ from our historical provisions and accruals, resulting in an adverse effect on our financial performance. \\n\\nLitigation or legal proceedings could expose us to significant liabilities and have a negative impact on our reputation or business. \\n\\nFrom time to time, we may be party to various claims and litigation proceedings. We evaluate these claims and litigation proceedings to assess the likelihood of unfavorable outcomes and to estimate, if possible, the amount of potential losses. Based on these assessments and estimates, we may establish reserves, as appropriate. These assessments and estimates are based on the information available to management at the time and involve a significant amount of management judgment. Actual outcomes or losses may differ materially from our assessments and estimates. For information regarding pending legal proceedings, please see Part I, Item 3 , Legal Proceedings, and Note 1 0 , Commitments and Contingencies , to the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included elsewhere in this report. \\n\\nEven when not merited, the defense of these lawsuits may divert our management’s attention, and we may incur significant expenses in defending these lawsuits. The results of litigation and other legal proceedings are inherently uncertain, and adverse judgments or settlements in some of these legal disputes may result in \\n\\nadverse monetary damages, penalties or injunctive relief against us, which could have a material adverse effect on our financial position, cash flows or results of operations. Any claims or litigation, even if fully indemnified or insured, could damage our reputation and make it more difficult to compete effectively or to obtain adequate insurance in the future. \\n\\nFurthermore, while we maintain insurance for certain potential liabilities, such insurance does not cover all types and amounts of potential liabilities and is subject to self-insured retentions, various exclusions as well as caps on amounts recoverable. Even if we believe a claim is covered by insurance, insurers may dispute our entitlement to recovery for a variety of potential reasons, which may affect the timing and, if the insurers prevail, the amount of our recovery. \\n\\nGeneral Risk Factors \\n\\nOur share price has been and may continue to be highly volatile, and you could lose all or part of your investment. \\n\\nThe market price of our common stock has been and is likely to continue to be highly volatile and could be subject to wide fluctuations in response to many factors discussed in this “ Risk Factors ” section, including: \\n\\n• general economic, market and political conditions, including negative effects on consumer confidence and spending levels; \\n\\n• actual or anticipated fluctuations in our financial condition and operating results, including fluctuations in our quarterly and annual results; \\n\\n• announcements of innovations by us or our competitors; \\n\\n• announcement by competitors or new market entrants of their entry into or exit from the plant-based meat market; \\n\\n• overall conditions in our industry and the markets in which we operate; \\n\\n• market conditions or trends in the packaged food sales industry or in the economy as a whole; \\n\\n• addition or loss of significant customers or other developments with respect to significant customers; \\n\\n• adverse developments concerning our manufacturers or suppliers; \\n\\n• changes in laws or regulations applicable to our products or business; \\n\\n• our ability to effectively manage our growth and market expectations with respect to our growth; \\n\\n• speculation regarding public customer announcements or geographic expansion; \\n\\n• actual or anticipated changes in our growth rate relative to our competitors; \\n\\n• announcements by us or our competitors of significant acquisitions, strategic partnerships, joint ventures or capital commitments; \\n\\n• additions or departures of key personnel; \\n\\n• competition from existing products or new products that may emerge; \\n\\n• issuance of new or updated research or reports about us or our industry, or positive or negative recommendations or withdrawal of research coverage by securities analysts; \\n\\n• our failure to meet the estimates and projections of the investment community or that we may otherwise provide to the public; \\n\\n• fluctuations in the valuation of companies perceived by investors to be comparable to us; \\n\\n• disputes or other developments related to proprietary rights, including patents, and our ability to obtain intellectual property protection for our products; \\n\\n• litigation or regulatory matters; \\n\\n• announcement or expectation of additional financing efforts; \\n\\n• our cash position; \\n\\n• our indebtedness and ability to pay such indebtedness, as well as our ability to comply with covenants under our credit agreement; \\n\\n• sales of our common stock by our stockholders; \\n\\n• issuance of equity or debt; \\n\\n• share price and volume fluctuations attributable to inconsistent trading volume levels of our common stock; \\n\\n• changes in accounting practices; \\n\\n• ineffectiveness of our internal controls; \\n\\n• short-selling of our common stock; \\n\\n• negative media or marketing campaigns undertaken by our competitors or lobbyists supporting the meat industry; \\n\\n• the public’s response to publicity relating to the health aspects or nutritional value of our products; \\n\\n• the effects of COVID-19 and any other pandemic, epidemic or other public health crisis; and \\n\\n• other events or factors, many of which are beyond our control. \\n\\nFurthermore, the stock markets have experienced price and volume fluctuations that have affected and continue to affect the market prices of equity securities of many companies. These fluctuations often have been unrelated or disproportionate to the operating performance of those companies. These broad market and industry fluctuations, as well as general economic, political and market conditions such as recessions, interest rate changes, tariffs, international currency fluctuations, or the effects of disease outbreaks or pandemics (such as COVID-19), may negatively impact the market price of our common stock. In the past, companies that have experienced volatility in the market price of their stock have been subject to securities class action litigation. For example, in the past, we have been subject to multiple shareholder derivative lawsuits related, in part, to a securities case filed against us alleging federal securities law violations with respect to past disclosure, which case has since been dismissed with prejudice. Securities litigation, and any other type of litigation, brought against us could result in substantial costs and divert our management’s attention from other business concerns, which could seriously harm our business and adversely affect our results of operations. \\n\\nFuture sales of our common stock in the public market could cause our share price to fall. \\n\\nSales of a substantial number of shares of our common stock in the public market could occur at any time. These sales, or the perception in the market that the holders of a large number of shares of common stock intend to sell shares, could reduce the market price of our common stock. Moreover, certain holders of our common stock have rights, subject to certain conditions, to require us to file registration statements covering their shares or to include their shares in registration statements that we may file for ourselves or other stockholders. We also have registered all shares of common stock that we may issue under our equity compensation plans following the IPO or that are issuable upon exercise of outstanding options following the \\n\\nIPO. These shares can be freely sold in the public market upon issuance and once vested, subject to volume limitations applicable to affiliates. If any of these additional shares are sold, or if it is perceived that they will be sold, in the public market, the market price of our common stock could decline. \\n\\nIf securities or industry analysts issue an adverse or misleading opinion regarding our business or publish unfavorable research about our business, our share price and trading volume could decline. \\n\\nThe trading market for our common stock depends in part on the research and reports that industry or securities analysts publish about us or our business. If one or more of the analysts who cover us ceases coverage of our company or fails to publish reports on us regularly, we could lose visibility in the financial markets, which in turn could cause our share price or trading volume to decline. Moreover, if any of the analysts who cover us downgrade our stock or issue an adverse or misleading opinion regarding us, our business model or our stock performance, or if our operating results fail to meet the expectations of the investor community, our share price could decline. \\n\\nWe have never paid dividends on our capital stock and we do not intend to pay dividends for the foreseeable future. Consequently, any gains from an investment in our common stock will likely depend on whether the price of our common stock increases. \\n\\nWe have never declared or paid any dividends on our common stock and do not intend to pay any dividends in the foreseeable future. We anticipate that we will retain all of our future earnings for use in the operation of our business and for general corporate purposes. Accordingly, investors should rely on sales of their common stock after price appreciation, which may never occur, as the only way to realize any future gains on their investments. \\n\\nOur charter documents and Delaware law could prevent a takeover that stockholders consider favorable and could also reduce the market price of our stock. \\n\\nOur restated certificate of incorporation and our amended and restated bylaws contain provisions that could delay or prevent a change in control of our company. These provisions could also make it more difficult for stockholders to elect directors and take other corporate actions. These provisions include: \\n\\n• providing for a classified board of directors with staggered, three-year terms; \\n\\n• authorizing our board of directors to issue preferred stock with voting or other rights or preferences that could discourage a takeover attempt or delay changes in control; \\n\\n• prohibiting cumulative voting in the election of directors; \\n\\n• providing that vacancies on our board of directors may be filled only by a majority of directors then in office, even though less than a quorum; \\n\\n• prohibiting the adoption, amendment or repeal of our amended and restated bylaws or the repeal of the provisions of our restated certificate of incorporation regarding the election and removal of directors without the required approval of at least 66.67% of the shares entitled to vote at an election of directors; \\n\\n• prohibiting stockholder action by written consent; \\n\\n• limiting the persons who may call special meetings of stockholders; and \\n\\n• requiring advance notification of stockholder nominations and proposals, including without limitation, compliance with the requirements of Rule 14a-19 under the Exchange Act, as applicable. \\n\\nThese provisions may frustrate or prevent any attempts by our stockholders to replace or remove our current management by making it more difficult for stockholders to replace members of our board of directors, which is responsible for appointing the members of our management. In addition, the provisions of Section 203 of the Delaware General Corporate Law, or the DGCL, govern us. These provisions may prohibit large \\n\\nstockholders, in particular those owning 15% or more of our outstanding voting stock, from merging or combining with us for a certain period of time without the consent of our board of directors. \\n\\nThese and other provisions in our restated certificate of incorporation and our amended and restated bylaws and under Delaware law could discourage potential takeover attempts, reduce the price investors might be willing to pay in the future for shares of our common stock and result in the market price of our common stock being lower than it would be without these provisions. \\n\\nOur restated certificate of incorporation provides that the Court of Chancery of the State of Delaware and the federal district courts of the United States of America will be the exclusive forums for substantially all disputes between us and our stockholders, which could limit our stockholders’ ability to obtain a favorable judicial forum for disputes with us or our directors, officers, or employees. \\n\\nOur restated certificate of incorporation provides that the Court of Chancery of the State of Delaware is the exclusive forum for: \\n\\n• any derivative action or proceeding brought on our behalf; \\n\\n• any action asserting a claim of breach of a fiduciary duty owed by, or other wrongdoing by, any of our directors, officers, employees or agents to us or our stockholders; \\n\\n• any action asserting a claim against us arising pursuant to any provision of the DGCL, our restated certificate of incorporation, or our amended and restated bylaws; \\n\\n• any action to interpret, apply, enforce or determine the validity of our restated certificate of incorporation or our amended and restated bylaws; and \\n\\n• any action asserting a claim against us that is governed by the internal affairs doctrine; \\n\\nprovided, that with respect to any derivative action or proceeding brought on our behalf to enforce any liability or duty created by the Exchange Act or the rules and regulations thereunder, the exclusive forum will be the federal district courts of the United States of America. Our restated certificate of incorporation further provides that the federal district courts of the United States of America will be the exclusive forum for resolving any complaint asserting a cause of action arising under the Securities Act. \\n\\nThese exclusive forum provisions may limit a stockholder’s ability to bring a claim in a judicial forum that it finds favorable for disputes with us or our directors, officers, or other employees, which may discourage lawsuits against us and our directors, officers and other employees. \\n\\nOur ability to utilize our federal net operating loss and tax credit carryforwards may be limited under Sections 382 and 383 of the Internal Revenue Code (the “Code”). \\n\\nAs of December 31, 2022, we had accumulated federal, state and foreign net operating loss carryforwards of approximately $744.5 million, $314.2 million and $84.1 million, respectively. Approximately $652.7 million of the federal net operating losses and $84.9 million of the state net operating losses do not expire and the remaining federal, state and foreign tax loss carryforwards begin to expire in 2031, 2031 and 2025, respectively, unless previously utilized. Utilization of the Company’s net operating loss and tax credit carryforwards may be subject to a substantial annual limitation due to the ownership change limitations provided by the Code and similar state provisions. \\n\\nThe limitations apply if a corporation undergoes an “ownership change,” which is generally defined as a greater than 50 percentage point change (by value) in its equity ownership by certain stockholders over a three-year period. We have experienced several ownership changes none of which is expected to result in a material limitation on the future use of our net operating loss and credit carryforwards generated prior to these ownership changes. However, any future changes in our stock ownership, which may be outside of our control, may trigger an ownership change and, consequently, Section 382 and 383 limitations. Similar provisions of state tax law \\n\\nmay also apply to limit our use of accumulated state tax attributes. As a result, if we earn net taxable income, our ability to use our pre-change net operating loss carryforwards and other tax attributes to offset such taxable income may be subject to limitations, which could potentially result in increased future income tax liability to us. We are currently analyzing whether and to what extent we have experienced an ownership change pursuant to Section 382; and to the extent such change occurred, the impact to the availability of our tax attributes. \\n\\n\""

       "['\\n\\nDisruptions in the worldwide economy, including an economic recession, downturn, periods of inflation or economic uncertainty, have and may continue to adversely affect our business, results of operations and financial condition. \\n\\nThe global economy can be negatively impacted by a variety of factors such as the spread or fear of spread of contagious diseases (such as the COVID-19 pandemic, other pandemics, epidemics or other public health crises) in locations where our products are sold, man-made or natural disasters, severe weather, actual or threatened hostilities or war, terrorist activity, political unrest, civil strife and other geopolitical uncertainty. Such adverse and uncertain economic conditions may impact distributor, retailer, foodservice and consumer demand for our products. For example, in connection with the war in Ukraine, governments in the U.S., U.K. and the EU have each imposed export controls on certain products and financial and economic sanctions on certain industry sectors and parties in Russia. The uncertainty resulting from the military conflict in Europe has given rise and may continue to give rise to increases in costs of goods and services, scarcity of certain ingredients, increased trade barriers or restrictions on global trade and may increase volatility in financial and capital markets, which may make it more difficult for us to raise additional capital. Further escalation of geopolitical tensions could have a broader impact that expands into other markets where we do business, which could adversely affect our business and/or our supply chain, our international subsidiaries, business partners or customers in the broader region, including potential destabilizing effects that such conflicts may pose for the European continent or the global oil and natural gas markets. In addition, our ability to manage normal commercial relationships with our suppliers, co-manufacturers, distributors, retailers, foodservice customers, consumers and creditors may suffer. \\n\\nStarting in 2020, the COVID-19 pandemic had a significant impact on the worldwide economy and, in turn, our business, financial condition and results of operations. Although we expect the impacts of the pandemic, and the resulting effects on the economy, on us to continue to decline, we are likely to see certain prolonged effects. For example, certain of our QSR customers reduced their menu offerings in response to COVID-19, which negatively impacted plant-based food items. If those customers are slow to re-expand their menus, or choose not to put plant-based products back on their menus, our business could be adversely affected. \\n\\nAs global economic conditions continue to be volatile or uncertain and recessionary or inflationary pressures exist, trends in consumer discretionary spending also remain unpredictable and subject to changes. We have seen consumers shift purchases to lower-priced or other perceived value offerings during economic downturns as a result of various factors, including job losses, inflation, higher taxes, reduced access to credit, change in federal economic policy and recent international trade disputes. In particular, consumers have reduced the amount of plant-based food products that they purchase where there are conventional animal-based protein offerings, which generally have lower retail prices. In addition, consumers may choose to purchase private label products rather than branded products because they are generally less expensive. A decrease in consumer discretionary spending may also result in consumers reducing the frequency and amount spent on food prepared away from home. Distributors, retailers and foodservice customers have become more conservative in response to these conditions and have sought to reduce their inventories. Our results of operations depend upon, among other things, our ability to maintain and increase sales volume with our existing distributors, retailer and foodservice customers, our ability to attract new consumers, the financial condition of our consumers and our ability to provide products that appeal to consumers at the right price. Decreases in demand for our products without a corresponding decrease in costs has put downward pressure on margins and has and may continue to negatively impact our financial results. Prolonged unfavorable economic \\n\\nconditions or uncertainty would be expected to have an adverse effect on our sales and profitability and may result in consumers making long-lasting changes to their discretionary spending behavior on a more permanent basis. \\n\\nInflationary price pressures of raw materials, labor, transportation, fuel or other inputs used by us and our suppliers, including the effects of rising interest rates, has negatively impacted, and could continue to negatively impact, our business and results of operations. \\n\\nOur operating environment has been impacted by inflation and rising interest rates. Increases in the price of raw materials, labor, wages, energy or other inputs that we or our suppliers use in manufacturing and supplying products, along with logistics, transportation, shipping, fuel and other related costs, has led to higher production and shipping costs for our products. Any increase in the cost of inputs to our production has led to higher costs for our products in our foodservice and retail channels and has negatively impacted and may continue to negatively impact our operating results and future profitability. General inflation, including rising energy prices, interest rates and wages, currency volatility and monetary, fiscal and policy interventions by national or regional governments in reaction to such events could continue to have negative impacts on our business by increasing our operating costs and our borrowing costs as well as decreasing the capital available for our customers to purchase our products. The United States Federal Reserve has raised its benchmark interest rate multiple times. Several other central banks, including the European Central Bank, have signaled increases in benchmark interest rates. Increased borrowing costs faced by our customers could result in decreased demand for our products. The impact of inflation could also reduce consumer confidence and decrease consumer discretionary spending, including spending to purchase our products, and negatively affect trends in consumer purchasing patterns due to changes in consumers’ disposable income, credit availability and debt levels. The impact of high inflation and the plant-based meat sector’s premium pricing relative to animal protein have caused and could continue to cause consumers to trade down into cheaper forms of protein, including animal meat. \\n\\nWe have a history of losses, and we may be unable to achieve or sustain profitability. \\n\\nWe have experienced net losses in almost every period since our inception. In 2022, 2021 and 2020, we incurred net losses of $366.1 million, $182.1 million and $52.8 million, respectively. Although we anticipate decreasing our operating expenses in 2023, over time our operating expenses and capital expenditures may increase as we hire additional employees; support our strategic and other QSR customer relationships; innovate and commercialize products; build our brand, expand our marketing channels and drive consumer adoption of our products; continue to invest to expand our production capacity through our own internal production facilities, domestically and abroad; build out our Campus Headquarters; increase our customer base, supplier network and co-manufacturing partners; scale production across distribution channels; pursue geographic expansion; and enhance our technology and production capabilities. These efforts may prove more expensive than we anticipate, and we may not succeed in increasing our revenues and margins sufficiently to offset the anticipated higher expenses. We incur significant expenses in developing our innovative products, building out our facilities, securing an adequate supply of raw materials, obtaining and storing ingredients and other products and marketing the products we offer. In addition, many of our expenses, including some of the costs associated with our existing and any future manufacturing facilities, are fixed. Accordingly, we may not be able to successfully implement our new sustainable growth strategy or achieve or sustain profitability, and we may incur significant losses for the foreseeable future. \\n\\nOur strategic initiatives to reduce our cost structure towards cash flow positive operations could have long-term adverse effects on our business, and we may not realize the operational or financial benefits from such actions. \\n\\nOur cost-reduction initiatives, expected charges and savings related to our recent workforce reductions and executive leadership changes, and the timing and success of achieving our cash flow positive targets are subject to many risks and uncertainties. The charges associated with the reduction-in-force and executive leadership changes may be greater than anticipated, completion of the reduction-in-force may take longer than anticipated, we may be unable to realize the contemplated benefits in connection with the workforce reduction, executive leadership changes and other potential cost-reduction initiatives, and the workforce reduction, \\n\\nexecutive leadership changes and cost-reduction initiatives may have an adverse impact on our performance. Additionally, our ability to meet our cash flow positive targets is subject to a number of assumptions and uncertainties, including, without limitation, our ability to reduce costs and achieve positive gross margins; our ability to meet certain revenue and operating expense targets, which may be subject to factors beyond our control; and our ability to monetize inventory and manage working capital. The other risks described in this report may also hinder our ability to implement our strategic initiatives. \\n\\nAs we continue to identify areas of cost savings and operating efficiencies, we may consider implementing further measures to help streamline operations and improve our cost efficiencies, including downsizing or exiting certain operations. However, our strategic growth initiatives may not be adequate to support the long-term operations of our business, particularly under adverse circumstances, Furthermore, we may not be successful in implementing these initiatives or realizing our anticipated savings and efficiencies, including as a result of factors beyond our control. In the event we have excess capacity or vacancy in any of our facilities or office spaces, we may sublease portions of the excess space to third parties and may be unable to sublease our excess space on favorable terms, or at all, or if we are able to sublease space but our subtenants fail to make lease payments to us or otherwise default on their obligations to us, we could incur substantial payment obligations to our landlords. If we are unable to realize the anticipated savings and efficiencies of our cost reduction initiatives and related strategic initiatives, our operating and financial results would be adversely affected and could differ materially from our expectations. \\n\\nOur inability to streamline operations and improve cost efficiencies could result in the contraction of our business and the implementation of significant cost cutting measures. \\n\\nWe have undertaken efforts to streamline operations and improve cost efficiencies, including related to our supply chain, marketing and commercialization efforts. For example, on August 3, 2022 and October 14, 2022, we announced reductions-in-force affecting approximately 4% and 19%, respectively, of our global workforce. We may not realize, in full or in part, the anticipated benefits, savings and improvements in our operating results from these efforts due to unforeseen difficulties, delays or unexpected costs. If we are unable to realize the expected operational efficiencies and cost savings, our operating results and financial condition would be adversely affected. We also cannot guarantee that we will not have to undertake additional workforce reductions in the future. Furthermore, our workforce reductions may be disruptive to our operations. For example, our workforce reductions could yield unanticipated consequences, such as attrition beyond planned staff reductions, increased difficulties in our day-to-day operations and reduced employee morale. In addition, while positions have been eliminated, certain functions necessary to our reduced operations remain, and we may be unsuccessful in distributing the duties and obligations of departed employees among our remaining employees. We may also discover that the reductions in workforce and cost cutting measures will make it difficult for us to pursue new opportunities and initiatives and require us to hire qualified replacement personnel, which may require us to incur additional and unanticipated costs and expenses. Moreover, there is no assurance we will be successful in our efforts. Our failure to successfully accomplish any of the above activities and goals may have a material adverse impact on our business, financial condition, and results of operations. \\n\\nIf we fail to effectively expand or optimize our manufacturing and production capacity, accurately forecast demand for our products or quickly respond to forecast changes, our business and operating results and our brand reputation could be harmed. \\n\\nIf we do not have sufficient capacity to meet our customers’ demands and to satisfy increased demand, or are not able to streamline and optimize manufacturing capacity for specific products, we will need to expand our operations, supply and manufacturing capabilities. However, there is risk in our ability to effectively scale production processes, optimize manufacturing capacity for specific products and effectively manage our supply chain requirements. We must accurately forecast demand for each of our products and inventory needs in order to ensure we have adequate available manufacturing capacity for each such product and to ensure we are effectively managing our inventory. Our forecasts are based on multiple assumptions which may cause our estimates to be inaccurate and affect our ability to obtain adequate manufacturing capacity (whether our own manufacturing capacity or co-manufacturing capacity) and adequate inventory supply in order to meet the \\n\\ndemand for our products, which could prevent us from meeting increased customer demand and harm our brand and our business and in some cases may result in fines or indemnification obligations we must pay customers or distributors if we are unable to fulfill orders placed by them in a timely manner or at all. \\n\\nConsumer demand for plant-based meat products has recently cooled down. For example, in the fourth quarter of 2022, all of our markets and channels were negatively impacted by softness in demand. If consumer demand for plant-based meats continues to decrease, or if any such decrease is prolonged, demand for our products by our customers may also decrease, which could in turn have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. \\n\\nFurthermore, if we do not accurately align our manufacturing capabilities and inventory supply with demand, if we experience disruptions or delays in our supply chain, or if we cannot obtain raw materials of sufficient quantity and quality at reasonable prices and in a timely manner, our business, financial condition and results of operations may be materially adversely affected. \\n\\nWe may not be able to utilize our capacity efficiently or accurately plan our capacity requirements, which may adversely affect our gross margin, business and operating results. \\n\\nIf we overestimate our demand and overbuild our capacity or inventory, we may have significantly underutilized assets. Underutilization of our manufacturing and/or co-manufacturing facilities can adversely affect our gross margin and other operating results. If demand for our products experiences a prolonged decrease, we may be required to terminate or make penalty-type payments under certain supply chain arrangements, close or idle facilities and write down our long-lived assets or shorten the useful lives of underutilized assets and accelerate depreciation, which would increase our expenses. \\n\\nIf demand does not materialize at the rate forecasted, we may not be able to scale back our manufacturing expenses or overhead costs quickly enough to correspond to the lower than expected demand. This could result in lower margins and adversely impact our business and results of operations. Additionally, if product demand decreases or we fail to forecast demand accurately, our results may be adversely impacted due to higher costs resulting from lower manufacturing utilization, causing higher fixed costs per unit produced. Further, we may be required to recognize excess or obsolete inventory write-off charges, or excess capacity charges, which would have a negative impact on our results of operations. \\n\\nIf we are unable to sell our inventory in a timely manner, it could become obsolete, which could require us to write-down or write-off obsolete inventory, which could harm our operating results. \\n\\nThere is a risk that we may be unable to sell our inventory in a timely manner to avoid it becoming obsolete. If we are required to substantially discount our inventory or are unable to sell our inventory in a timely manner, we would be required to increase our inventory reserves or write off obsolete inventory and our operating results could be substantially harmed. Alternatively, we may be required to mark down certain products to sell any excess inventory or to sell such inventory through liquidation channels at significantly lower prices, which would negatively impact our business and operating results. In the year ended December 31, 2022, our net revenues were negatively impacted by strategic price reductions, and our gross profit was negatively impacted by higher inventory reserves, which increased costs per pound. \\n\\nOur ability to accurately forecast our future results of operations is subject to many risks and uncertainties and our operating and financial results could differ materially from our expectations. \\n\\nOur ability to accurately forecast our future results of operations is limited and subject to a number of risks and uncertainties. Our historical revenue growth should not be considered indicative of our future performance and our revenue growth could slow or our revenue could decline for a number of reasons, including slowing demand for our products, increasing competition from our market competitors and new market entrants, and a decrease in the growth of our overall market. In fact, net revenues in the year ended December 31, 2022 decreased by $45.8 million, or 9.8%, as compared to the prior year. If we are unable to identify and execute cost-down initiatives intended to achieve price parity with animal protein, we may not be able to compete effectively in our market, demand for our products may continue to slow and could continue to adversely affect \\n\\nour revenues and margins. If our assumptions regarding these risks and uncertainties and our future revenue growth are incorrect or change, or if we do not address these risks successfully, our operating and financial results could differ materially from our expectations, and our business could suffer. \\n\\nFrom time to time, we may release earnings guidance, financial goals or other forward-looking statements in our earnings releases, earnings conference calls or otherwise regarding our future performance that represent our management’s estimates as of the date of the release. Some or all of the assumptions of any future guidance or financial goals that we furnish may not materialize or may vary significantly from actual future results. For example, our ability to meet our cash flow positive targets is subject to a number of assumptions and uncertainties, including, without limitation, our ability to reduce costs and achieve positive gross margins; our ability to meet certain revenue and operating expense targets, which may be subject to factors beyond our control; and our ability to monetize inventory and manage working capital. \\n\\nWe estimate market opportunity and forecast market growth that may prove to be inaccurate, and even if the market in which we compete achieves the forecasted growth, our business could fail to grow at similar rates, if at all. \\n\\nOur estimates of market opportunity and growth forecasts are subject to significant uncertainty and are based on assumptions and estimates that may prove to be inaccurate. The factors that go into the calculation of our market opportunity are subject to change over time and may be variable or inaccurate and may be affected by increasing competition from our market competitors and new market entrants. Any expansion in our market depends on a number of factors, including the cost and perceived value associated with our product and those of our competitors. Even if the market in which we compete meets the size estimates and growth forecast, our business could fail to grow at the rate we anticipate, if at all. Our growth is subject to many factors, including our success in implementing our business strategy, which is subject to many risks and uncertainties. \\n\\nBecause we rely on a limited number of third-party suppliers, we may not be able to obtain raw materials on a timely basis or in sufficient quantities at competitive prices to produce our products or meet the demand for our products. \\n\\nWe rely on a limited number of vendors, a portion of which are located internationally, to supply us with raw materials. Our financial performance depends in large part on our ability to arrange for the purchase of raw materials in sufficient quantities at competitive prices. We have entered into a multi-year sales agreement for plant-based protein with one of our pea protein suppliers pursuant to which we are required to purchase specified minimum monthly and semi-annual quantities through the term. In addition, we have entered into a supply agreement with another supplier pursuant to which we obtain pea protein on a purchase order basis and have the right to cancel purchase orders if we provide timely written notice. The amount purchased in each quarter of 2023 is mutually agreed upon by us and the supplier prior to each quarter and becomes a binding quarterly commitment upon such agreement. Other than pursuant to these agreements, we are not assured of continued supply or pricing of raw materials. Any of our other suppliers could discontinue or seek to alter their relationship with us. We have in the past experienced interruptions in the supply of pea protein from one supplier that resulted in delays in delivery to us. We could experience similar delays in the future from any of our suppliers. Any disruption in the supply of pea protein or other raw materials would have a material adverse effect on our business if we cannot replace these suppliers in a timely manner, on commercially reasonable terms, or at all. \\n\\nIn addition, our pea protein suppliers manufacture their products at a limited number of facilities. A natural disaster, severe weather, fire, power interruption, work stoppage or other calamity affecting any of these facilities, or any interruption in their operations, could negatively impact our ability to obtain required quantities of pea protein in a timely manner, or at all, which could materially reduce our product sales and net revenues, and have a material adverse effect on our business and financial condition. \\n\\nEvents that adversely affect our suppliers of pea protein and other raw materials could impair our ability to obtain raw material inventory in the quantities at competitive prices that we desire. Such events include problems with our suppliers’ businesses, finances, labor relations and/or shortages, strikes or other labor \\n\\nunrest, ability to import raw materials, product quality issues, costs, production, insurance and reputation, as well as local economic and political conditions, restrictive U.S. and foreign governmental actions, such as restrictions on transfers of funds and trade protection measures, including export/import duties and quotas and customs duties and tariffs, adverse fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates, changes in legal or regulatory requirements, border closures, disease outbreaks or pandemics (such as COVID-19), acts of war, terrorism, natural disasters, fires, earthquakes, flooding, severe weather, agricultural diseases or other catastrophic occurrences. We continuously seek alternative sources of protein to use in our products, but we may not be successful in diversifying the raw materials we use in our products. \\n\\nIf we need to replace an existing supplier, there can be no assurance that supplies of raw materials will be available when required on acceptable terms, or at all, or that a new supplier would allocate sufficient capacity to us in order to meet our requirements, fill our orders in a timely manner or meet our strict quality standards. If we are unable to manage our supply chain effectively and ensure that our products are available to meet consumer demand, we may not be able to fulfill customer orders, our operating costs could increase and our profit margins could decrease. \\n\\nDisruptions of our supply chain could have a material adverse effect on our operating and financial results. \\n\\nOur ability to make, move and sell products in coordination with our suppliers, third party contract manufacturers and distributors is critical to our success. Damage or disruption to our collective supply, manufacturing or distribution capabilities resulting from severe weather, fires or evacuations related thereto, natural disasters, including climate-related events, pandemics (such as the COVID-19 pandemic) or other outbreaks of contagious diseases, agricultural diseases, cyber incidents, terrorism, governmental restrictions or mandates, political instability, trade restrictions, import restrictions, border closures, freight carrier availability, labor shortages, strikes or other labor unrest, the financial or operational instability of key suppliers and carriers, repairs or enhancements at facilities manufacturing or delivering our products or other reasons could impair our ability to source inputs or manufacture, sell or timely deliver our products. To the extent we are unable to mitigate the likelihood or potential impact of such events, there could be a material adverse effect on our operating and financial results. \\n\\nAdditionally, there are increasing expectations in various jurisdictions that companies monitor the environmental and social performance of their suppliers, including compliance with a variety of labor practices, as well as consider a wider range of potential environmental and social matters, including the end of life considerations for products. Compliance can be costly, require us to establish or augment programs to diligence or monitor our suppliers, or, in the case of legislation such as the Uyghur Forced Labor Prevention Act, to design supply chains to avoid certain suppliers or regions altogether. Failure to comply with such regulations can result in fines, reputational damage, import ineligibility for certain products or raw materials, or otherwise adversely impact our business. \\n\\nOur future business, results of operations and financial condition may be adversely affected by reduced or limited availability of plant-based protein that meets our standards. \\n\\nOur ability to ensure a continuing supply of ingredients at competitive prices depends on many factors beyond our control, such as the number and size of farms that grow certain crops such as Canadian, European and North American yellow peas, the vagaries of these farming businesses (including poor harvests impacting the quality of the peas grown), changes in national and world economic conditions, including as a result of COVID-19 or the outbreak of hostilities or war, tariffs and our ability to forecast our ingredient requirements. The high-quality ingredients used in many of our products are vulnerable to adverse weather conditions and natural disasters, such as floods, droughts, frosts, earthquakes, hurricanes and pestilence. Adverse weather conditions and natural disasters can lower crop yields and reduce crop size and quality, which in turn could reduce the available supply of, or increase the price of, quality ingredients. In addition, we purchase some ingredients and other materials offshore, and the price and availability of such ingredients and materials may be affected by political events or other conditions in these countries or tariffs, trade wars or the outbreak of hostilities or war. We also compete with other food producers in the procurement of ingredients, and this competition may \\n\\nincrease in the future if consumer demand for plant-based meat products increases. If supplies of quality ingredients are reduced or there is greater demand for such ingredients from us and others, we may not be able to obtain sufficient supply that meets our strict quality standards on favorable terms, or at all, which could impact our ability to supply products and may adversely affect our business, results of operations and financial condition. \\n\\nWe rely on a limited number of distributors, and if we experience the loss of one or more distributors and cannot replace them in a timely manner, our results of operations may be adversely affected. \\n\\nMany retailers and foodservice providers purchase our products through distributors who purchase, store, sell, and deliver our products to such retailers and foodservice providers. For 2022, DOT accounted for 12% of our gross revenues. For 2021, DOT and Zandbergen WFM accounted for approximately 12% and 11% of our gross revenues, respectively. Since these distributors act as intermediaries between us and the retailers and foodservice providers, we do not have short-term or long-term commitments or minimum purchase volumes in our contracts with them that ensure future sales of our products. If we lose one or more of our distributors and cannot replace the distributor in a timely manner or at all, our business, results of operation and financial condition may be materially adversely affected. \\n\\nIf we fail to cost-effectively acquire new customers or retain our existing customers, or if we fail to derive revenue from our existing customers consistent with our historical performance, our business could be materially adversely affected. \\n\\nOur success, and our ability to increase revenues and operate profitably, depends in part on our ability to cost-effectively acquire new customers, to retain existing customers, and to keep existing customers engaged so that they continue to purchase products from us. We intend to continue to expand our number of foodservice customers, both in the United States and internationally, as part of our growth strategy. This may require us to provide marketing and other financial incentives to our customers to assist in the promotion of our products. Such additional incentives could have a negative impact on gross margin and may not necessarily result in increased sales. In addition, new national foodservice customers will often initially add certain of our product offerings to their menus at limited locations and/or on a limited test basis, after which time these customers may choose to no longer offer our products or may ultimately scale back subsequent expansions. If we fail to attract and retain new foodservice customers, or retain our existing foodservice customers, our business, financial condition and results of operations could be materially adversely affected. In addition, timing of retail shelf resets are not within our control, and to the extent that retail customers change the timing of such events, reduce our in store-displays or are not able to restock our products effectively, sales of our products may be impaired and negatively impact our revenues. \\n\\nFurther, if customers do not perceive our product offerings to be of sufficient value and quality, or if we fail to offer new and relevant product offerings at a competitive price, we may not be able to attract or retain customers or engage existing customers so that they continue to purchase products from us. We may lose customers to our competitors if they offer superior products to ours, if we are unable to compete on the basis of value and taste, if we are unable to meet customers’ orders in a timely manner, or if we are unable to identify and execute cost-down initiatives intended to achieve price parity with animal protein. The loss of any large customer or the reduction of purchasing levels or the cancellation of business from such customers could have a material adverse impact on our business. \\n\\nConsolidation of customers or the loss of a significant customer could negatively impact our sales and profitability. \\n\\nSupermarkets in North America and the European Union continue to consolidate. This consolidation has produced larger, more sophisticated organizations with increased negotiating and buying power that are able to resist price increases, as well as operate with lower inventories, decrease the number of brands that they carry and increase their emphasis on private label products, all of which could negatively impact our business. The consolidation of retail customers also increases the risk that a significant adverse impact on their business could have a corresponding material adverse impact on our business. \\n\\nThe loss of any large customer, the reduction of purchasing levels or the cancellation of any business from a large customer for an extended length of time could negatively impact our sales and profitability. For example, in 2022, the year-over-year decrease in our U.S. foodservice channel net revenues was driven primarily by sales to a large QSR customer in the year-ago period that did not repeat in the fourth quarter of 2022. \\n\\nFurthermore, as retailers consolidate, they may reduce the number of branded products they offer in order to accommodate private label products and generate more competitive terms from branded suppliers competing for limited retailer shelf space. Consequently, our financial results may fluctuate significantly from period to period based on the actions of one or more significant retailers. A retailer may take actions that affect us for reasons that we cannot always anticipate or control, such as their financial condition, changes in their business strategy or operations, the introduction of competing products, pricing and promotions, shelf reset timing and activity, reduced in store-displays, timing of product restocking or the perceived quality of our products. Despite operating in different channels, our retailers sometimes compete for the same consumers as our foodservice channel. Because of actual or perceived conflicts resulting from this competition, retailers may take actions that negatively affect us. \\n\\nLoss of one or more of our co-manufacturers or our failure to timely identify and establish relationships with new co-manufacturers could harm our business and impede our growth. \\n\\nA significant amount of our revenue is derived from products manufactured at manufacturing facilities owned and operated by our co-manufacturers, a portion of which are located internationally. Any of the co-manufacturers with whom we do not have a written contract could seek to alter or terminate its relationship with us at any time, leaving us with periods during which we have limited or no ability to manufacture our products. If we need to replace a co-manufacturer, there can be no assurance that additional capacity will be available when required on acceptable terms, or at all. \\n\\nAn interruption in, or the loss of operations at, one or more of our co-manufacturing facilities, which may be caused by work stoppages, labor shortages, strikes or other labor unrest, production disruptions, product quality issues, local economic and political conditions, restrictive governmental actions, border closures, disease outbreaks or pandemics (such as COVID-19), the outbreak of hostilities, acts of war, terrorism, fire, earthquakes, severe weather, flooding or other natural disasters at one or more of these facilities, could delay, postpone or reduce production of some of our products, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition until such time as such interruption is resolved or an alternate source of production is secured. \\n\\nWe believe there are a limited number of competent, high-quality co-manufacturers in the industry that meet our strict quality and control standards, and as we seek to continue to obtain additional or alternative co-manufacturing arrangements in the future, there can be no assurance that we would be able to do so on satisfactory terms, in a timely manner, or at all. Additionally, as we expand our operations internationally, we will need to develop relationships with co-manufacturers overseas to meet sales demand, and there can be no assurance that we will be able to successfully do so. Therefore, the loss of one or more co-manufacturers, any disruption or delay at a co-manufacturer or any failure to identify and engage co-manufacturers for new products, product extensions and expanded operations could delay, postpone or reduce production of our products, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition. \\n\\nAny damage or disruption at our domestic or international manufacturing facilities may harm our business. \\n\\nWe have manufacturing facilities in the United States, China and the Netherlands to produce our woven proteins and our finished goods. A natural disaster, severe weather, fire, power interruption, work stoppage, labor shortages, strikes or other labor unrest, border closures, restrictive governmental actions, outbreaks of pandemics or contagious diseases (such as COVID-19) or other calamity at any of these facilities would significantly disrupt our ability to deliver our products and operate our business. If any material amount of our machinery or inventory were damaged, we would be unable to meet our contractual obligations and cannot \\n\\npredict when, if at all, we could replace or repair such machinery, which could materially adversely affect our business, financial condition and operating results. \\n\\nOur business could be adversely affected by a workplace accident or safety incident. \\n\\nOur manufacturing processes and related activities could expose us to significant personal injury claims that could subject us to substantial liability. Specifically, our inability to anticipate or preempt potential workplace hazards, create safe working environments or timely adapt to changing requirements around maintaining a safe workplace could result in employee illness, accidents or other safety incidents. A failure to properly train our employees regarding, or respond appropriately and in a timely manner to, any such illness, accident or safety incident could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operation and reputation. While we maintain liability insurance in amounts and of the type generally consistent with industry practice, the amount of such coverage may not be adequate to cover fully all claims, and we may be forced to bear substantial losses from an accident or safety incident resulting from our manufacturing activities. \\n\\nWe may not successfully ramp up operations at our facilities or these facilities may not operate in accordance with our expectations. Moreover, we face competition for employees and may be unable to hire and retain employees at these facilities. \\n\\nSince June 2018, we have acquired facilities by purchase or lease in the United States, China and the Netherlands. Any substantial delay in bringing these facilities up to full production on our current schedule may hinder our ability to produce all of the product needed to meet orders and/or achieve our expected financial performance. Opening these facilities has required, and will continue to require, additional capital expenditures and the efforts and attention of our management and other personnel, which has and will continue to divert resources from our existing business or operations. These efforts may prove more expensive than we anticipate, and we may not succeed in increasing our revenues and margins sufficiently to offset the anticipated higher expenses. Additionally, our inability to hire and retain skilled employees at these facilities will severely hamper our expansion plans, product development and manufacturing efforts. The unemployment rate in the Columbia, Missouri market was 2.8% as of December 2022 and labor market conditions remain relatively tight. As a result, we currently rely on temporary workers in addition to full-time employees, and in the future, we may be unable to attract and retain employees with the skills we require, which could impact our ability to expand our operations. Even if our facilities are brought up to full production according to our current schedule, it may not provide us with all of the operational and financial benefits we expect to receive. \\n\\nOur facilities and the manufacturing equipment we use to produce our products is costly to replace or repair and may require substantial lead-time to do so. For example, our estimate of throughput or our extrusion capacity may be impacted by disruption from extruder lead-in time, calibration, maintenance and unexpected delays. In addition, our ability to procure new extruders may face more lengthy lead times than is typical. We may also not be able to find suitable alternatives with co-manufacturers to replace the output from such equipment on a timely basis and at a reasonable cost. In the future, we may also experience plant shutdowns or periods of reduced production because of regulatory issues, equipment failure, delays in raw material deliveries or other adverse events. Any such disruption or unanticipated event may cause significant interruptions or delays in our business and the reduction or loss of inventory may render us unable to fulfill customer orders in a timely manner, or at all. We have property and business disruption insurance in place for all of our manufacturing facilities; however, such insurance coverage may not be sufficient to cover all of our potential losses and may not continue to be available to us on acceptable terms, or at all. \\n\\nWe may face difficulties as we expand our operations in other countries, including into those in which we have no prior operating experience. \\n\\nWe intend to continue to expand our global footprint and enter into new markets. International operations involve a number of risks, including labor shortages, strikes or other labor unrest, border closures, restrictive governmental actions, foreign regulatory compliance, tariffs, taxes and exchange controls, economic downturns, inflation, foreign currency fluctuations and political and social instability in the countries in which we operate. Expansion may involve expanding into countries other than those in which we currently operate. It may also involve expanding into less developed countries, which may have less political, social or economic stability and less developed infrastructure and legal systems. In addition, it may be difficult for us to understand and accurately predict taste preferences and purchasing habits of consumers in these new geographic markets. It is costly to establish, develop and maintain international operations and develop and promote our brands in international markets. As we expand our business into other countries, we may encounter regulatory, legal, personnel, technological and other difficulties that increase our expenses and/or delay our ability to become profitable in such countries, which may have a material adverse effect on our business and brand. \\n\\nOur revenue growth rate has fluctuated in recent periods and may continue to slow or decline in the future. \\n\\nWe experienced significant revenue growth in prior periods. However, our revenue growth and revenues have slowed or declined, with periods of negative growth, and may continue to slow or decline in future periods due to a number of potential factors, including without limitation, macroeconomic issues including inflation and rising interest rates, increasing concerns about the likelihood of a recession, and potential impacts on consumer and customer behavior, and demand levels, increasing competition, market saturation, slowing demand for our offerings, increasing regulatory costs and challenges, failure to capitalize on growth opportunities and the long-term effects of the COVID-19 pandemic. \\n\\nOur revenues and earnings may fluctuate as a result of our promotional activities. \\n\\nWe routinely offer sales discounts and promotions through various programs to customers and consumers which may result in reduced margins. These programs include rebates, temporary on-shelf price reductions, off-invoice discounts, retailer advertisements, product coupons and other trade activities. We anticipate that we will need to continue to offer more trade and promotion discounts to both our retail and foodservice customers, to drive increased consumer trial and in response to changing consumer behavior and increased competition. We expect to face increasing competition across all channels, especially as additional plant-based meat product brands continue to enter the marketplace. In response, we anticipate providing heavier discounting and promotions on some of our products. Although these actions are intended to build brand awareness and increase consumer trials of our products, they have had and are likely to continue to have a negative impact on our net revenues, gross profit, gross margin and profitability, impacting period-over-period results. \\n\\nFluctuations in our results of operations for our second and third quarters may impact, and may have a disproportionate effect on our overall financial condition and results of operations. \\n\\nOur business is subject to seasonal fluctuations that may have a disproportionate effect on our results of operations. Generally, we expect to experience greater demand for certain of our products during the summer grilling season. We continue to see additional seasonality effects, especially within our retail channel, with revenue contribution from this channel tending to be greater in the second and third quarters of the year, along with increased levels of purchasing by customers ahead of holidays, the impact of customer shelf reset activity and the timing of product restocking by our retail customers. Any factors that harm our second and third quarter operating results, including disruptions in our supply chain, adverse weather or unfavorable economic conditions, may have a disproportionate effect on our results of operations for the entire year. In an environment of recessionary and inflationary pressures, general softness in the plant-based category, competition and other factors impacting our business, including uncertainty around the long-term impacts of COVID-19, we are unable to assess the ultimate impact on the demand for our products as a result of seasonality. \\n\\nHistorical results are not indicative of future results. \\n\\nHistorical quarter-to-quarter and period-over-period comparisons of our sales and operating results are not necessarily indicative of future quarter-to-quarter and period-over-period results. You should not rely on the results of a single quarter or period as an indication of our annual results or our future performance. \\n\\nFailure by our transportation providers to deliver our products on time, or at all, could result in lost sales. \\n\\nWe currently rely upon third-party transportation providers for a significant portion of our product shipments. Our utilization of delivery services for shipments is subject to risks, including increases in fuel prices, which would increase our shipping costs, employee strikes, disease outbreaks or pandemics (such as COVID-19) and inclement weather, which may impact the ability of providers to provide delivery services that adequately meet our shipping needs, if at all. We periodically change shipping companies, and we could face logistical difficulties that could adversely affect deliveries. In addition, we could incur costs and expend resources in connection with such change. Moreover, we may not be able to obtain terms as favorable as those we receive from the third-party transportation providers that we currently use, which in turn would increase our costs and thereby adversely affect our operating results. \\n\\nWe have undergone, and may continue to experience, changes to our executive leadership team and senior management, and if we are unable to integrate new members of our executive leadership team or senior management, or if we fail to retain members of our executive leadership team and senior management, our business and operations may be adversely affected. \\n\\nOur success is substantially dependent on the continued service of certain members of our senior management, including Ethan Brown, our Founder, President and Chief Executive Officer. These executives have been primarily responsible for determining the strategic direction of our business and for executing our growth strategy and are integral to our brand, culture and the reputation we enjoy with suppliers, co-manufacturers, distributors, customers and consumers. The loss of the services of any of these executives could have a material adverse effect on our business and prospects, as we may not be able to find suitable individuals to replace them on a timely basis, if at all. In addition, any such departure could be viewed in a negative light by investors and analysts, which may cause the price of our common stock to decline. We do not currently carry key-person life insurance for our senior executives. \\n\\nFrom time to time, there may be changes in our executive leadership team and senior management as a result of the hiring, departure or realignment of key personnel, and such changes may impact our business. In 2021 and 2022, we have had several changes to our executive leadership team and senior management, including as a result of organizational changes based on cost-reduction initiatives. Any significant leadership change or senior management transition involves inherent risk and any failure to ensure the timely and suitable replacement and a smooth transition could hinder our strategic planning, business execution and future performance. In particular, these or any future leadership transitions may result in a loss of personnel with deep institutional or technical knowledge and changes in business strategy or objectives and have the potential to disrupt our operations and relationships with employees and customers due to added costs, operational inefficiencies, changes in strategy, decreased employee morale and productivity, and increased turnover. If we are unable to successfully integrate new executive leadership team members and senior management, our operations may be adversely affected and we may not be able to achieve our operating objectives. \\n\\nIf we are unable to attract, train and retain employees or maintain our company culture, we may not be able to grow or successfully operate our business. \\n\\nOur success depends in part upon our ability to attract, train and retain a sufficient number of employees who understand and appreciate our culture and can represent our brand effectively and establish credibility with our business partners and consumers. We believe a critical component of our success has been our company culture and long-standing core values. We have invested substantial time and resources in building our team. If we are unable to hire and retain employees capable of meeting our business needs and expectations, or if we \\n\\nfail to preserve our company culture among a larger number of employees dispersed in various geographic regions, our business and brand image may be impaired. Any failure to meet our staffing needs or any material increase in turnover rates of our employees or key personnel changes may adversely affect our business, results of operations and financial condition. \\n\\nFurthermore, in 2022, we implemented two reductions in force, which together impacted 19% of our global workforce. Although we believe these reductions will be an important part of the success of our cost-reduction initiatives, they may adversely affect employee morale, our culture and our ability to attract and retain critical employees. They may also negatively impact our ability to pursue new initiatives due to insufficient resources and personnel. We may be unsuccessful in distributing duties and obligations of impacted employees among the remaining employees. We also may not realize the anticipated benefits and cost savings and may suffer unintended consequences, such as the loss of institutional knowledge, higher than expected employee turnover and significant disruptions in our day-to-day operations. If we are unable to realize the expected operational efficiencies or cost savings from the reductions in force, or if we experience significant adverse consequences as a result, our business, financial conditions and results of operations may be adversely affected. \\n\\nSome of our international employees are employed by professional employer organizations. \\n\\nPrior to January 1, 2022, we contracted with a professional employer organization, or U.S. PEO, that administered our human resources, payroll and employee benefits functions for our employees in the United States. Effective as of January 1, 2022, such human resources, payroll and employee benefits functions are no longer performed by the U.S. PEO. We continue to contract with non-U.S. PEOs to perform the same functions as the U.S. PEO for the majority of our employees outside the United States. Although we recruit and select our workers, each of these workers is also an employee of record of the relevant non-U.S. PEO. As a result, these workers are compensated through the relevant PEO, are governed by the work policies created by the relevant PEO and receive their annual wage statements and other payroll or labor related reports from the relevant PEO (e.g., T-4s for employees in Canada). This relationship permits management to focus on operations and profitability rather than payroll administration, but this relationship also exposes us to some risks. Among other risks, if any of the non-U.S. PEOs fail to adequately withhold or pay employer taxes or to comply with applicable laws, we may be held liable for such violations notwithstanding any indemnification provisions with the non-U.S. PEOs. In certain non-U.S. jurisdictions, the worker may be deemed a direct employee and the potential liability for any non-compliance with applicable laws increases depending on whether a company has an entity or other corporate presence in the country, among other factors set forth under applicable local laws. \\n\\nCourt and administrative proceedings related to matters of employment tax, labor law and other laws applicable to PEO arrangements could distract management from our business and cause us to incur significant expense. If we were held liable for violations by PEOs, such amounts may adversely affect our profitability and could negatively affect our business and results of operations. \\n\\nWe depend on a limited number of third party service providers for the performance of several of our business operations, including payroll and human capital management services. \\n\\nIf any of these third party providers were to experience significant interruptions in their business operations, terminate their agreements with the company, or fail to perform the services required under the terms of the company’s contracts with them, its own processing could be materially and adversely affected for an indefinite period of time. There can be no assurance that the company would be able to locate alternative providers of such services, or that it could do so at economical rates. \\n\\nFuture acquisitions or investments could disrupt our business and harm our financial condition. \\n\\nIn the future, we may pursue acquisitions or investments that we believe will help us achieve our strategic objectives. We may not be able to find suitable acquisition candidates, and even if we do, we may not be able to complete acquisitions on favorable terms, if at all. If we do complete acquisitions, we may not ultimately achieve our goals or realize the anticipated benefits. The pursuit of acquisitions and any integration process will require significant time and resources and could divert management time and focus from operation of our then-existing \\n\\nbusiness, and we may not be able to manage the process successfully. Any acquisitions we complete could be viewed negatively by our customers or consumers. An acquisition, investment or business relationship may result in unforeseen operating difficulties and expenditures, including disrupting our ongoing operations and subjecting us to additional liabilities, increasing our expenses, and adversely impacting our business, financial condition and operating results. Moreover, we may be exposed to unknown liabilities related to the acquired company or product, and the anticipated benefits of any acquisition, investment or business relationship may not be realized if, for example, we fail to successfully integrate such acquisition into our company. To pay for any such acquisitions, we would have to use cash, incur debt, or issue debt or equity securities, each of which may affect our financial condition or the value of our common stock and could result in dilution to our stockholders. If we incur more debt it would result in increased fixed obligations and could also subject us to covenants or other restrictions that would impede our ability to manage our operations. Our acquisition strategy could require significant management attention, disrupt our business and harm our business, financial condition and results of operations. \\n\\nOur business and reputation could be negatively impacted by the increased scrutiny from our stakeholders and institutional investors on ESG practices. \\n\\nThere is an increased focus from a variety of stakeholders on corporate ESG practices, including climate change and related ESG disclosure requirements. Expectations regarding voluntary ESG initiatives and disclosures may result in increased costs (including but not limited to increased costs related to compliance, stakeholder engagement, contracting and insurance), changes in demand for certain products, enhanced compliance or disclosure obligations, or other adverse impacts to our business, financial condition, or results of operations. \\n\\nWhile we may at times engage in voluntary initiatives (such as voluntary disclosures, certifications, or goals, among others) to improve the ESG profile of our company and/or products, such initiatives or achievements of such commitments may be costly and may not have the desired effect. Expectations around the Company’s management of ESG matters continues to evolve rapidly, in many instances due to factors that are out of our control. For example, we may not ultimately be able to complete certain goals or initiatives, either on the timelines originally anticipated or at all, due to technical, cost, or other factors, which may be in or out of our control. Moreover, actions or statements that we may take based on based on expectations, assumptions, or third-party information that we currently believe to be reasonable may subsequently be determined to be erroneous or be subject to misinterpretation. Even if this is not the case, our current actions may subsequently be determined to be insufficient by various stakeholders, and we may be subject to investor or regulator engagement on our ESG initiatives and disclosures, even if such initiatives are currently voluntary. \\n\\nCertain market participants, including stockholders and other capital providers, use third-party benchmarks or scores to measure a company’s ESG practices and decide whether to invest in their common stock or engage with them to require changes to their practices. In addition, certain influential institutional investors are also increasing their focus on ESG practices and are placing importance on the implications and social cost of their investments. If our ESG practices do not meet the standards set by these stockholders, they may choose not to invest in our common stock or if our peer companies outperform us in their ESG initiatives, potential or current investors may elect to invest with our competitors instead. Increasing governmental and societal attention to ESG matters, including expanding mandatory and voluntary reporting, diligence and disclosure on topics such as climate change, human capital, labor and risk oversight, could also expand the nature, scope and complexity of matters that we are required to control, assess and report. For example, to the extent ESG matters negatively impact our reputation, it may also impede our ability to compete as effectively to attract and retain employees, customers, or business partners, which may adversely impact our operations. We may be especially subject to scrutiny on such matters given efforts to portray our operations and products as a more sustainable and conscientious alternative to certain competitor products. As another example, the SEC has proposed rules that would require companies to provide significantly expanded climate-related disclosures in their periodic reporting, which may require us to incur significant additional costs to comply, including the implementation of significant additional internal controls processes and procedures regarding matters that have not been subject to such controls in the past, and impose increased oversight obligations on our management \\n\\nand board of directors. These and other regulations, disclosure-related and otherwise, may increase our costs as well as increase scrutiny regarding our ESG efforts, which may enhance the risks discussed in this risk factor. If we do not comply with investor or stockholder expectations and standards in connection with our ESG initiatives, are perceived to have not responded appropriately to address ESG issues within our company, or fail to adapt to or comply with all laws, regulations, policies and related interpretations, our business and reputation could be negatively impacted and our share price and access to/cost of capital could be materially and adversely affected. Additionally, many of our customers and suppliers may be subject to similar expectations, which may augment or create additional risks, including risks that may not be known to us. \\n\\nThe Company is subject to accounting estimate risks. \\n\\nThe preparation of the Company’s consolidated financial statements in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles requires management to make significant estimates that affect the financial statements. Estimates are made at specific points in time and based on facts, historical experience and various other factors believed to be reasonable under the circumstances at such time. If actual results differ from our judgments and assumptions, then it may have an adverse impact on the results of our operations and cash flows. \\n\\n',\n",
       " '\\n\\nFood safety and food-borne illness incidents may materially adversely affect our business by exposing us to lawsuits, product recalls or regulatory enforcement actions, increasing our operating costs and reducing demand for our product offerings. \\n\\nSelling food for human consumption involves inherent legal and other risks, and there is increasing governmental scrutiny of and public awareness regarding food safety. Unexpected side effects, illness, injury or death related to allergens, food-borne illnesses or other food safety incidents caused by products we sell, or involving our suppliers or co-manufacturers, could result in the discontinuance of sales of these products or our relationships with such suppliers or co-manufacturers, or otherwise result in increased operating costs, regulatory enforcement actions or harm to our reputation. Shipment of adulterated or misbranded products, even if inadvertent, can result in criminal or civil liability. Such incidents could also expose us to product liability, negligence or other lawsuits, including consumer class action lawsuits. Any claims brought against us may exceed or be outside the scope of our existing or future insurance policy coverage or limits. Any judgment against us that is more than our policy limits or not covered by our policies or not subject to insurance would have to be paid from our cash reserves, which would reduce our capital resources. \\n\\nThe occurrence of food-borne illnesses or other food safety incidents could also adversely affect the price and availability of affected ingredients, resulting in higher costs, disruptions in supply and a reduction in our sales. Furthermore, any instances of food contamination or regulatory noncompliance, whether or not caused by our actions, could compel us, our suppliers, our distributors or our customers, depending on the circumstances, to conduct a recall in accordance with FDA regulations, comparable state laws or foreign laws such as those of the European Union, the United Kingdom and China. Food recalls could result in significant losses due to their costs, the destruction of product inventory, lost sales due to the unavailability of the product for a period of time and potential loss of existing distributors or customers and a potential negative impact on our ability to attract new customers due to negative consumer experiences or because of an adverse impact on our brand and reputation. The costs of a recall could exceed or be outside the scope of our existing or future insurance policy coverage or limits. \\n\\nIn addition, food companies have been subject to targeted, large-scale tampering as well as to opportunistic, individual product tampering, and we, like any food company, could be a target for product tampering. Forms of tampering could include the introduction of foreign material, chemical contaminants and pathological organisms into consumer products as well as product substitution. FDA regulations require companies like us to analyze, prepare and implement mitigation strategies specifically to address tampering (i.e., intentional adulteration) designed to inflict widespread public health harm. If we do not adequately address the possibility, or any actual instance, of intentional adulteration, we could face possible seizure or recall of our \\n\\nproducts and the imposition of civil or criminal sanctions, which could materially adversely affect our business, financial condition and operating results. \\n\\nConsumer preferences for our products are difficult to predict and may change, and, if we are unable to respond quickly to new trends and demands, our business may be adversely affected. \\n\\nOur business is focused on the development, manufacture, marketing and distribution of a line of branded plant-based meat products as alternatives to animal-based protein products. Consumer demand could change based on a number of possible factors, including dietary habits and nutritional values, concerns regarding the health effects of ingredients and shifts in preference for various product attributes. If consumer demand for our products decreased, our business and financial condition would suffer. In addition, sales of plant-based meat or meat-alternative products are subject to evolving consumer preferences that we may not be able to accurately predict or respond to. Consumer trends that we believe favor sales of our products could change based on a number of possible factors, including a shift in preference from plant-based meat to animal-based protein products (including any products produced using new farming methods or technologies which may reduce the adverse environmental and other factors associated with conventional animal-based protein products), increased acceptance for different alternative proteins that are used in our products, economic factors and social trends. A significant shift in consumer demand away from our products could reduce our sales or our market share and the prestige of our brand, which would harm our business and financial condition. \\n\\nAdditionally, lobbyists supporting the meat industry have engaged in marketing campaigns in an attempt to generate negative publicity regarding our products and may continue to do so in the future. Any shift in consumer perception that our products are not healthy as a result of these campaigns could significantly reduce the value of our brand and damage our business. Other types of adverse publicity concerning our business or the plant-based meat industry generally could also harm our brand, reputation and results of operations. The growing use of social and digital media over recent years has amplified the impact of such negative publicity. \\n\\nSales of the Beyond Burger contribute a significant portion of our revenue. A reduction in sales of Beyond Burger would have an adverse effect on our financial condition. \\n\\nBeyond Burger accounted for approximately 50%, 55% and 58% of our gross revenues in 2022, 2021 and 2020, respectively. The Beyond Burger is our flagship product and has historically been the focal point of our development and marketing efforts, and we believe that sales of the Beyond Burger will continue to constitute a significant portion of our revenues, income and cash flow for the foreseeable future. We cannot be certain that we will be able to continue to expand production and distribution of the Beyond Burger, or that customer demand for our other existing and future products will expand to allow such products to represent a larger percentage of our revenue than they do currently. Accordingly, any factor adversely affecting sales of the Beyond Burger could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. \\n\\nFailure to continually innovate and successfully introduce and commercialize new products or successfully improve existing products may adversely affect our ability to continue to grow. \\n\\nA key element of our long-term growth strategy depends on our ability to develop and market new products and improvements to our existing products that meet our standards for quality and appeal to consumer preferences. The success of our innovation and product development efforts is affected by our ability to anticipate changes in consumer preferences, accurately predict taste preferences and purchasing habits of consumers in new geographic markets, the technical capability of our innovation staff in developing and testing product prototypes, including complying with applicable governmental regulations, commercialization and scale-up of new products, and the success of our management and sales and marketing teams in introducing and marketing new products. Our innovation staff members are continuously testing alternative plant-based proteins to the proteins we currently use in our products, as they seek to find additional protein options to our current ingredients that are more easily sourced, and which retain and build upon the quality and appeal of our current product offerings. Failure to develop, commercialize and market new products that appeal to consumers may lead to a decrease in our growth, sales and profitability. \\n\\nAdditionally, the development and introduction of new products requires substantial research, development and marketing expenditures, which we may be unable to recoup if the new products do not gain widespread market acceptance. If we are unsuccessful in meeting our objectives with respect to new or improved products, our business could be harmed. \\n\\nIngredient and packaging costs are volatile and may rise significantly, which may negatively impact the profitability of our business. \\n\\nWe purchase large quantities of raw materials, including ingredients derived from Canadian, European and North American yellow peas, mung beans, sunflower seeds, rice, faba beans, canola oil and coconut oil. In addition, we purchase and use significant quantities of cardboard, film and plastic to package our products. Costs of ingredients and packaging are volatile and can fluctuate due to conditions that are difficult to predict, including global competition for resources, weather conditions, consumer demand and changes in governmental trade and agricultural programs. Volatility in the prices of raw materials and other supplies we purchase could increase our cost of sales and reduce our profitability. Moreover, we may not be able to implement price increases for our products to cover any increased costs, and any price increases we do implement may result in lower sales volumes. If we are not successful in managing our ingredient and packaging costs, if we are unable to increase our prices to cover increased costs or if such price increases reduce our sales volumes, then such increases in costs will adversely affect our business, results of operations and financial condition. \\n\\n',\n",
       " '\\n\\nWe face intense competition in our market from our competitors, including manufacturers of animal-based meat products and other brands that produce plant-based meat products, and potential competitors and new market entrants and we may lack sufficient financial or other resources to compete successfully. \\n\\nOur future success depends, in large part, on our ability to implement our long-term growth strategy of expanding supply and distribution, improving placement of our products, attracting new consumers to our brand and introducing new products and product extensions, and expanding into new geographic markets. If we fail to implement this growth strategy or if we invest resources in a growth strategy that ultimately proves unsuccessful, our sales and operating results will be adversely affected. Our ability to implement this growth strategy depends, among other things, on our ability to: \\n\\n• manage relationships with various suppliers, co-manufacturers, distributors, customers and other third parties, and expend time and effort to integrate new suppliers, co-manufacturers, distributors and customers into our fulfillment operations; \\n\\n• continue to compete in retail and foodservice channels; \\n\\n• secure placement in the meat case for our products; \\n\\n• increase our brand recognition and expand and maintain brand loyalty; \\n\\n• develop new product lines and extensions; and \\n\\n• expand into new geographic markets. \\n\\nOur ability to implement our long-term growth strategy also depends on our ability to continue to compete in the retail and foodservice channels. We operate in a highly competitive environment. Numerous brands and products compete for limited retailer shelf space, foodservice customers and consumers. In our market, competition is based on, among other things, taste, nutritional profile, ingredients, texture, ease of integration into the consumer diet, low-carbohydrate, low-sugar, high fiber and protein, lack of cholesterol, soy, gluten and GMOs, convenience, price and promotion tactics, brand awareness and loyalty among customers, media spending, product variety and packaging, access to major retailer shelf space and retail locations, access to \\n\\nmajor foodservice outlets and integration into menus, innovation and intellectual property protection on products. \\n\\nIn response to increased competition, as well as the COVID-19 pandemic, we have recently been providing heavier discounting on some of our products. Although these actions are intended to build brand awareness and increase consumer trials of our products, they have had, and may continue to have, a negative impact on our net revenues, gross profit, gross margin and profitability, impacting period-over-period results. \\n\\nWe compete with conventional animal-protein companies such as Cargill, Hormel, JBS, Perdue Foods, Tyson and WH Group, who may have substantially greater financial and other resources than us and whose animal-based products are well-accepted in the marketplace today. They may also have lower operational costs, and as a result may be able to offer conventional animal meat to customers at lower costs than plant-based meat. This could cause us to lower our prices, resulting in lower profitability or, in the alternative, cause us to lose market share if we fail to lower prices. \\n\\nWe also compete with other food brands, including brands affiliated with conventional animal-protein companies and other large food operators, that develop and sell plant-based meat products, including, but not limited to, Alpha Foods, Boca Foods (Kraft Heinz), Lightlife and Field Roast Grain Meat Co. (Maple Leaf Foods), Gardein (Conagra), Hungry Planet, Inc., Impossible Foods, Incogmeato/Morningstar Farms (Kellogg), Moving Mountains, Omn!pork (OmniFoods), Tofurky, Sweet Earth and Awesome Burger (Nestle’ S.A.), Pure Farmland by Smithfield Foods (WH Group), Raised & Rooted (Tyson), Happy Little Plants (Hormel), Sysco’s Simply Plant-Based Meatless Burger, Tattooed Chef, The Not Company and Vegetarian Butcher (Unilever), and with companies which may be more innovative, have more resources and be able to bring new products to market faster and to more quickly exploit and serve niche markets. For example, a number of U.S. and international companies are working on developing lab-grown or “clean meat,” an animal-protein product cultivated from cells taken from animals, which could have a similar appeal to consumers as plant-based meat products. We compete with these competitors for foodservice customers, retailer shelf space and consumers. \\n\\nGenerally, the food industry is dominated by multinational corporations with substantially greater resources and operations than us. We cannot be certain that we will successfully compete with larger competitors that have greater financial, sales and technical resources or with new competitors and market entrants. Conventional food companies may acquire our competitors or launch their own plant-based meat products, and they may be able to use their resources and scale to respond to competitive pressures and changes in consumer preferences by introducing new products, reducing prices or increasing promotional activities, among other things. Retailers also market competitive products under their own private labels, which are generally sold at lower prices and compete with some of our products. Similarly, retailers could change the merchandising of our products and we may be unable to retain the placement of our products in meat cases to effectively compete with animal-protein products. Competitive pressures, new competitors and market entrants or other factors could cause us to lose market share, which may require us to lower prices, increase marketing and advertising expenditures, or increase the use of discounting or promotional campaigns, each of which would adversely affect our margins and could result in a decrease in our operating results and profitability. \\n\\nOur brand and reputation may be diminished due to real or perceived quality or health issues with our products, which could have an adverse effect on our business, reputation, operating results and financial condition. \\n\\nWe believe our consumers rely on us to provide them with high-quality plant-based meat products. Therefore, real or perceived quality or food safety concerns or failures to comply with applicable food regulations and requirements, whether or not ultimately based on fact and whether or not involving us (such as incidents involving our competitors), could cause negative publicity and reduced confidence in our company, brand or products, or the industry as a whole, which could in turn harm our reputation and sales, and could materially adversely affect our business, financial condition and operating results. Although we believe we have a rigorous quality control process, there can be no assurance that our products will always comply with the standards set for our products, and although we strive to keep our products free of pathogenic organisms, they may not be easily detected and cross-contamination can occur. For example, in 2017, before our products were \\n\\nshipped to distributors or customers, we discovered, through our quality control process, that certain of our products manufactured by a former co-manufacturer were contaminated with salmonella. There is no assurance that this health risk will always be preempted by our quality control processes. \\n\\nWe have no control over our products once purchased by consumers. Accordingly, consumers may prepare our products in a manner that is inconsistent with our directions or store our products for long periods of time, which may adversely affect the quality and safety of our products. If consumers do not perceive our products to be safe or of high quality, then the value of our brand would be diminished, and our business, results of operations and financial condition would be adversely affected. \\n\\nAny loss of confidence on the part of consumers in the ingredients used in our products or in the safety and quality of our products would be difficult and costly to overcome. Any such adverse effect could be exacerbated by our position in the market as a purveyor of high-quality plant-based meat products and may significantly reduce our brand value. Issues regarding the safety of any of our products, regardless of the cause, may have a substantial and adverse effect on our brand, reputation and operating results. \\n\\nThe growing use of social and digital media by us, our consumers and third parties increases the speed and extent that information or misinformation and opinions can be shared. Negative publicity about us, our brands or our products on social or digital media could seriously damage our brands and reputation. If we do not maintain the favorable perception of our brands, our sales and profits could be negatively impacted. \\n\\nIf we fail to develop and maintain our brand, our business could suffer. \\n\\nWe have developed a strong and trusted brand that has contributed significantly to the success of our business, and we believe our continued success depends on our ability to maintain and grow the value of the Beyond Meat brand. Maintaining, promoting and positioning our brand and reputation will depend on, among other factors, the success of our plant-based product offerings, food safety, quality assurance, marketing and merchandising efforts, the nutritional benefits provided by our products and our ability to provide a consistent, high-quality customer experience. Any negative publicity, regardless of its accuracy, could materially adversely affect our business, results of operation and reputation. Brand value is based on perceptions of subjective qualities, and any incident that erodes the loyalty of our customers, suppliers or co-manufacturers, including adverse publicity, negative media or a governmental investigation or litigation, could significantly reduce the value of our brand and significantly damage our business. \\n\\n',\n",
       " '\\n\\nOur international expansion into China and Europe could expose us to substantial business, regulatory, political, financial and economic risks. \\n\\nOur expansion into China and Europe could expose us to substantial risks associated with doing business in China and Europe, such as risks associated with taxation, inflation, environmental regulations, foreign currency exchange rates, the labor market, property and financial regulations, the COVID-19 pandemic or other public health crises, and the outbreak of hostilities or war. Our ability to operate in China and Europe may be adversely affected by changes in, or our failure to comply with, Chinese or European laws and regulations. In addition, we are exposed to risks associated with our workforce in China and the Netherlands, including with respect to changes in employment and labor laws, which could increase our operating costs. The departure of the United Kingdom from the European Union (commonly known as “Brexit”) on January 31, 2020 has created uncertainties affecting business operations in the U.K., EU and a number of other countries, which could increase volatility in exchange rates, market instability, costs and other risks. There is also significant uncertainty about the future relationship between the United States and China with respect to trade policies, treaties, government regulations and tariffs. \\n\\nFluctuations in currency exchange rates could negatively impact our earnings. \\n\\nA portion of our international business is conducted in currencies other than the U.S. dollar, and therefore changes in foreign exchange rates relative to the U.S. dollar have in the past, and may in the future, affect the \\n\\nvalue of our non‑U.S. dollar net assets, revenues and expenses. Although we closely monitor potential exposures as a result of these fluctuations in currencies, and where cost‑justified we adopt strategies that are designed to reduce the impact of these fluctuations on our financial performance, there can be no assurance that we will be successful in managing our foreign exchange risk. Our exposure to currency exchange rate fluctuations will grow if the relative contribution of our operations outside the United States increases. Any material fluctuations in currencies could have a material effect on our financial condition, results of operations and cash flows. \\n\\nOur international operations are subject to the FCPA and we could be adversely affected by violations of the FCPA and similar worldwide anti-corruption laws. \\n\\nThe FCPA and similar worldwide anti-corruption laws generally prohibit companies and their intermediaries from making certain improper payments for the purpose of obtaining or retaining business. The continued expansion of our international operations could increase the risk of violations of these laws in the future. There is no assurance that we will be completely effective in ensuring our compliance with the FCPA or any other applicable anti-corruption laws. If we are not in compliance with the FCPA and other anti-corruption laws, we may be subject to criminal and civil penalties, disgorgement and other sanctions and remedial measures, and legal expenses, which could have an adverse impact on our business, financial condition, results of operations and liquidity. Likewise, any investigation of any potential violations of the FCPA or other anti-corruption laws or trade control laws by the United States could also have an adverse impact on our reputation, our business, results of operations and financial condition. \\n\\n',\n",
       " '\\n\\nOur manufacturing operations in China and Europe require substantial investments, for which we cannot guarantee forecasted returns. \\n\\nIn 2020, we entered into an investment agreement and related factory leasing contract to design and develop manufacturing facilities in the Jiaxing Economic & Technological Development Zone to manufacture plant-based meat products under the Beyond Meat brand in China and in the fourth quarter of 2021, we leased an approximately 12,000 square foot facility in Shanghai, which is used as a local research and development facility to support our local manufacturing operations. In the second quarter of 2020, we acquired our first manufacturing facility in Europe located in Enschede, the Netherlands. Our substantial investment in China and Europe may expose us to substantial risks and, as a result, we may not realize a return on our investment. Unforeseen delays in the operations of our Chinese or European manufacturing facilities may cause us to incur additional expenses. Operating these facilities may require additional capital expenditures and the efforts and attention of our management and other personnel, which will divert resources from our existing business or operations. Although our Chinese and European facilities are fully operational as of December 31, 2022, they may not provide us with all of the operational and financial benefits we expect to receive. These and other risks may result in our not realizing a return on, or losing some or all, of our planned investments in China and Europe, which could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and financial performance. \\n\\nOur ownership of real property is subject to all the risks inherent in an investment in real estate. \\n\\nWe have direct ownership of certain real estate properties. As is the case with any owner of real property, we are subject to potential liabilities, cost and damages arising out of owning, operating, leasing or otherwise having interests in real property. There are risks that a property may have unforeseen environmental or other hazards resulting in unexpected costs. In addition, we may not be able to expand or operate our owned facilities in the manner we desire, which could adversely impact our production and facility utilization. \\n\\nJoint ventures may not operate according to their business plans if our partners fail to fulfill their obligations, which may adversely affect our results of operations and compel us to dedicate additional resources to these joint ventures. \\n\\nThe nature of a joint venture requires us to share control in certain areas with unaffiliated third parties. If our joint venture partner does not fulfill its obligations, the affected joint venture may not be able to operate in \\n\\naccordance with its business plan. Under such a scenario, our results of operations may be adversely affected and we may be compelled to increase the level of our resources devoted to the joint venture. Also, differing views among joint venture participants may result in delayed decisions, or failure to agree on major issues. If such differences caused a joint venture to deviate from its business plan, our results of operations could be adversely affected. \\n\\n',\n",
       " \"\\n\\nWe may not be able to protect our proprietary technology adequately, which may impact our commercial success. \\n\\nOur commercial success depends in part on our ability to protect our intellectual property and proprietary technologies. We rely on a combination of patent protection, where appropriate and available, copyrights, trade secrets and trademark laws, as well as confidentiality and other contractual restrictions to protect our proprietary technology. However, these legal means afford only limited protection and may not adequately protect our proprietary technology or permit us to gain or keep any competitive advantage. As of December 31, 2022, we had two issued patents in the United States and seven issued patents outside the United States (U.K., Indonesia, Canada, China, Chile, Israel and Australia), two pending patent applications in the United States, eight pending international patent applications and one provisional patent application. \\n\\nWe cannot offer any assurances about which, if any, patents will issue from these applications, the breadth of any such patents, or whether any issued patents will be found invalid and unenforceable or will be threatened by third parties. Any successful opposition to these patents or any other patents owned by or, if applicable in the future, licensed to us could deprive us of rights necessary for the successful commercialization of products that we may develop. Since patent applications in the United States and most other countries are confidential for a period of time after filing (in most cases 18 months after the filing of the priority application), we cannot be certain that we were the first to file on the technologies covered in several of the patent applications related to our technologies or products. Furthermore, a derivation proceeding can be provoked by a third party, or instituted by the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office, or USPTO, to determine who was the first to invent any of the subject matter covered by the patent claims of our applications. \\n\\nPatent law can be highly uncertain and involve complex legal and factual questions for which important principles remain unresolved. In the United States and in many international jurisdictions, policy regarding the breadth of claims allowed in patents can be inconsistent and/or unclear. The U.S. Supreme Court and the Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit have made, and will likely continue to make, changes in how the patent laws of the United States are interpreted. Similarly, international courts and governments have made, and will continue to make, changes in how the patent laws in their respective countries are interpreted. We cannot predict future changes in the interpretation of patent laws by U.S. and international judicial bodies or changes to patent laws that might be enacted into law by U.S. and international legislative bodies. \\n\\nWe may not be able to protect our intellectual property adequately, which may harm the value of our brand. \\n\\nWe believe that our intellectual property has substantial value and has contributed significantly to the success of our business. Our trademarks, including Beyond Meat, Beyond Burger, Beyond Beef, Beyond Sausage, Beyond Breakfast Sausage, Beyond Chicken, Beyond Steak, Beyond Fried Chicken, Beyond Popcorn Chicken, Beyond Meatballs, the Caped Steer Logo, Go Beyond, Eat What You Love, Cookout Classic and The Future of Protein, are valuable assets that reinforce our brand and consumers’ favorable perception of our products. We also rely on unpatented proprietary expertise, recipes and formulations and other trade secrets and copyright protection to develop and maintain our competitive position. Our continued success depends, to a significant degree, upon our ability to protect and preserve our intellectual property, including our trademarks, trade dress, trade secrets and copyrights. We rely on confidentiality agreements and trademark, trade secret and copyright law to protect our intellectual property rights. \\n\\nOur confidentiality agreements with our employees and certain of our consultants, contract workers, suppliers and independent contractors, including some of our co-manufacturers who use our formulations to manufacture our products, generally require that all information made known to them be kept strictly confidential. Nevertheless, trade secrets are difficult to protect. Although we attempt to protect our trade secrets, our confidentiality agreements may not effectively prevent disclosure of our proprietary information and may not provide an adequate remedy in the event of unauthorized disclosure of such information. If we do not keep our trade secrets confidential, others may produce products with our recipes or formulations. In addition, others may independently discover our trade secrets, in which case we would not be able to assert trade secret rights against such parties. Further, some of our formulations have been developed by or with our suppliers and co-manufacturers. As a result, we may not be able to prevent others from using similar formulations. As we begin to expand globally as part of our long-term growth strategy, we may face additional risks protecting our trade secrets internationally, where the laws may not be as protective of intellectual property rights as those in the United States. \\n\\nWe cannot assure you that the steps we have taken to protect our intellectual property rights are adequate, that our intellectual property rights can be successfully defended and asserted in the future or that third parties will not infringe upon or misappropriate any such rights. In addition, our trademark rights and related registrations may be challenged in the future and could be canceled or narrowed. Failure to protect our trademark rights could prevent us in the future from challenging third parties who use names and logos similar to our trademarks, which may in turn cause consumer confusion or negatively affect consumers’ perception of our brand and products. Moreover, intellectual property disputes and proceedings and infringement claims may result in a significant distraction for management and significant expense, which may not be recoverable regardless of whether we are successful. Such proceedings may be protracted with no certainty of success, and an adverse outcome could subject us to liabilities, force us to cease use of certain trademarks or other intellectual property or force us to enter into licenses with others. Any one of these occurrences may have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition. \\n\\nAdditionally, the laws of certain international jurisdictions in which our products may be sold may not protect intellectual property rights to the same extent as the laws of the United States. As a result, we may not be able to effectively prevent third parties from infringing or otherwise misappropriating our trademark rights in such jurisdictions. Moreover, failure to obtain adequate trademark rights in these foreign jurisdictions could negatively impact our ability to expand our business and launch products in certain international markets. Further, we may not be able to effectively protect our intellectual property rights against unauthorized third parties that obtain the rights to our trademarks in foreign jurisdictions where we have not yet applied for trademark protections, and we may expend substantial cost to obtain those trademarks from such third parties. Any one of these occurrences could reduce our competitive position or otherwise have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition. \\n\\nWe rely on information technology systems and any inadequacy, failure, interruption or security breaches of those systems may harm our ability to effectively operate our business. \\n\\nWe are dependent on various information technology systems, including, but not limited to, networks, applications and outsourced services in connection with the operation of our business. A failure of our information technology systems to perform as we anticipate could disrupt our business and result in transaction errors, processing inefficiencies and loss of sales, causing our business to suffer. In addition, our information technology systems may be vulnerable to damage or interruption from circumstances beyond our control, including fire, severe weather, natural disasters, systems failures, viruses and security breaches, particularly in light of many of our employees working remotely. Any such damage or interruption could have a material adverse effect on our business. \\n\\nA cybersecurity incident, other technology disruptions or failure to comply with laws and regulations relating to privacy and the protection of data relating to individuals could negatively impact our business, our reputation and our relationships with customers. \\n\\nWe use computers in substantially all aspects of our business operations. We also use mobile devices, social networking and other online activities to connect with our employees, suppliers, co-manufacturers, distributors, customers and consumers. Such uses give rise to cybersecurity risks, including security breaches, espionage, system disruption, theft and inadvertent release of information. Our business involves the storage and transmission of numerous classes of sensitive and/or confidential information and intellectual property, including customers’ and suppliers’ information, private information about employees and financial and strategic information about us and our business partners. Further, as we pursue new initiatives that improve our operations and cost structure, potentially including acquisitions, we may also expand and improve our information technologies, resulting in a larger technological presence and corresponding exposure to cybersecurity risk. If we fail to assess and identify cybersecurity risks associated with new initiatives or acquisitions, we may become increasingly vulnerable to such risks. Additionally, while we have implemented measures to prevent security breaches and cyber incidents, our preventative measures and incident response efforts may not be entirely effective. The theft, destruction, loss, misappropriation, or release of sensitive and/or confidential information or intellectual property, or interference with our information technology systems or the technology systems of third parties on which we rely, could result in business disruption, negative publicity, brand damage, violation of privacy laws, loss of customers, potential liability and competitive disadvantage all of which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition or results of operations. \\n\\nIn addition, we are subject to laws, rules and regulations in the United States, the European Union, China and other jurisdictions relating to the collection, use and security of personal information and data. Such data privacy laws, regulations and other obligations may require us to change our business practices and may negatively impact our ability to expand our business and pursue business opportunities. We may incur significant expenses to comply with the laws, regulations and other obligations that apply to us. Additionally, the privacy and data protection-related laws, rules and regulations applicable to us are subject to significant change. Several jurisdictions have passed new laws and regulations in this area, and other jurisdictions are considering imposing additional restrictions. For example, our operations are subject to the European Union’s General Data Protection Regulation, which imposes data privacy and security requirements on companies doing business in the European Union, including substantial penalties for non-compliance. The California Consumer Privacy Act (the “CCPA”), which went into effect on January 1, 2020, imposes similar requirements on companies handling data of California residents and creates a new and potentially severe statutory damages framework for (i) violations of the CCPA and (ii) businesses that fail to implement reasonable security procedures and practices to prevent data breaches. The California Privacy Rights Act, which became effective January 1, 2023, amends and expands the CCPA, including by expanding consumer’s rights in their personal information and creating a new governmental agency to interpret and enforce the statute. Additionally, in August 2021, the National People’s Congress of the People's Republic of China adopted the Personal Information Protection Law, which became effective on November 1, 2021 and provides a comprehensive system for the protection of personal information in China. Privacy and data protection-related laws and regulations also may be interpreted and enforced inconsistently over time and from jurisdiction to jurisdiction. Any actual or perceived inability to comply with applicable privacy or data protection laws, regulations, or other obligations could result in significant cost and liability, litigation or governmental investigations, damage our reputation, and adversely affect our business. \\n\\n\",\n",
       " \"\\n\\nIf the build out of our new Campus Headquarters is delayed or incurs cost overruns, the headquarters does not operate in accordance with our expectations or occupancy rates are lower than anticipated, our business or financial condition or results of operations may be adversely affected. \\n\\nOn January 14, 2021, we entered into a lease agreement for an initial term of 12 years to develop and house our new Campus Headquarters. The space is being built out by the landlord, who delivered Phase 1-A of the space, which we currently occupy, to us in the third quarter of 2022. We expect the landlord to deliver to us the remainder of the space by the end of 2023; however, there can be no assurances that the remainder of the space will be ready for occupancy on or before the expected occupancy date due to force majeure events (such as COVID-19) or the risk of delays or cost overruns inherent in construction development projects, any of which could have a negative impact on our financial condition or results of operations. If we are not able to complete development of the Campus Headquarters within the approved budget or there are significant cost overruns, our cash flows, financial condition, or results of operations could be materially and adversely affected. \\n\\nIn addition, it is possible that, once finalized, there could be unanticipated difficulties in initiating operations at the Campus Headquarters, including, but not limited to, IT system interruptions, other infrastructure support problems or the space may prove to be less conducive to our operations than currently anticipated. These risks could all result in operational inefficiencies or similar difficulties that could prove difficult or impossible to remediate and have an adverse impact on our financial condition or results of operations. Moreover, we are uncertain about how the long-term impacts of COVID-19 (for example, a shift in the percentage of our workforce that works remotely) will affect our ability to timely fully occupy the Campus Headquarters once construction is complete, which could have a negative impact on our financial condition or results of operations. \\n\\nIf we are unable to occupy the Campus Headquarters space, we may have to sublease the unoccupied portion of the Campus Headquarters. A sublease agreement would be subject to certain risks and uncertainties, such as the possibility that such agreement may not be completed on terms that are advantageous to us as we may not receive sufficiently high rental rates to cover our lease obligations which could have a negative impact on our financial condition and results of operations. \\n\\nWe currently have, and will continue to have, significant lease obligations, and our failure to meet those obligations could adversely affect our financial condition and business. \\n\\nWe currently have, and will continue to have, significant lease obligations for our corporate offices, manufacturing facilities, research and development facilities and warehouses. We depend on cash flow from operations to pay our lease expenses. \\n\\nIf our business does not generate sufficient cash flow from operating activities to fund these expenses, we may not be able to meet our lease obligations, which could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and business. Furthermore, the significant cash flow required to satisfy our financial obligations under the leases could limit our ability to incur indebtedness and make capital expenditures or other investments in our business. \\n\\nOur significant indebtedness and liabilities could limit the cash flow available for our operations, expose us to risks that could adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations and impair our ability to satisfy our obligations under our Notes. \\n\\nAs of December 31, 2022, we had approximately $1.3 billion of consolidated indebtedness and other liabilities. We may also incur additional indebtedness to meet future financing needs. Our indebtedness could have significant negative consequences for our security holders and our business, results of operations and financial condition by, among other things: \\n\\n• increasing our vulnerability to adverse economic and industry conditions; \\n\\n• limiting our ability to obtain additional financing; \\n\\n• requiring the dedication of a substantial portion of our cash flow from operations to service our indebtedness, which will reduce the amount of cash available for other purposes; \\n\\n• limiting our flexibility to plan for, or react to, changes in our business; \\n\\n• diluting the interests of our existing stockholders as a result of issuing shares of our common stock upon conversion of the Notes; and \\n\\n• placing us at a possible competitive disadvantage with competitors that are less leveraged than us or have better access to capital. \\n\\nIn March 2021, we issued $1.0 billion aggregate principal amount of our 0% Convertible Senior Notes due 2027 (the “Convertible Notes”) in a private placement to qualified institutional buyers pursuant to Rule 144A under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended (the “Securities Act”). The initial purchasers of the Convertible Notes also exercised their option to purchase an additional $150.0 million aggregate principal amount of our 0% Convertible Senior Notes due 2027 (the “Additional Notes,” and together with the Convertible Notes, the “Notes”), and such Additional Notes were issued on March 16, 2021. \\n\\nOur ability to make scheduled payments of the principal of, to pay interest on or to refinance our current or future indebtedness, including the Notes, as applicable, depends on our future performance, which is subject to economic, financial, competitive and other factors beyond our control. Our business may not generate sufficient funds, and we may otherwise be unable to maintain sufficient cash reserves, to pay amounts due under our current or future indebtedness, including the Notes, and our cash needs may increase in the future. In addition, any future indebtedness that we may incur may contain financial and other restrictive covenants that limit our ability to operate our business, raise capital or make payments under our other indebtedness. If we fail to comply with these covenants or to make payments under our indebtedness when due, then we would be in default under that indebtedness, which could, in turn, result in that and our other indebtedness becoming immediately payable in full. \\n\\nWe may be unable to raise the funds necessary to repurchase the Notes for cash following a fundamental change, or to pay the cash amounts due upon conversion, and our future indebtedness may limit our ability to repurchase the Notes or pay cash upon their conversion. \\n\\nHolders of the Notes may, subject to a limited exception, require us to repurchase their Notes following a “Fundamental Change” (as defined in the Indenture) at a cash repurchase price generally equal to the principal amount of the Notes to be repurchased, plus accrued and unpaid special and additional interest, if any. In addition, all conversions of Notes will be settled partially or entirely in cash. We may not have enough available cash or be able to obtain financing at the time we are required to repurchase the Notes or pay the cash amounts due upon conversion. In addition, applicable law, regulatory authorities and the agreements governing our future indebtedness may restrict our ability to repurchase the Notes or pay the cash amounts due upon conversion. Our failure to repurchase the Notes or to pay the cash amounts due upon conversion when required will constitute a default under the Indenture. A default under the Indenture or the Fundamental Change itself could also lead to a default under agreements governing our future indebtedness, which may result in that indebtedness becoming immediately payable in full. If the repayment of such future indebtedness were to be accelerated after any applicable notice or grace periods, then we may not have sufficient funds to repay that indebtedness and repurchase the Notes or make cash payments upon their conversion. \\n\\nThe accounting method for the Notes could adversely affect our reported financial condition and results. \\n\\nOur Notes do not bear regular interest, and the principal amount of the Notes do not accrete. However, special interest and additional interest may accrue on the Notes at a rate per annum not exceeding 0.50% (subject to certain exceptions) upon the occurrence of certain events relating to the failure to file certain SEC reports or to remove certain restrictive legends from the Notes. The accounting method for reflecting the Notes \\n\\non our balance sheet may adversely affect our reported earnings and financial condition. If any of the conditions to the convertibility of the Notes is satisfied or the Notes become due within one year, then we may be required under applicable accounting standards to reclassify the liability carrying value of the Notes as a current, rather than a long-term, liability. This reclassification could be required even if no noteholders convert their Notes and could materially reduce our reported working capital. \\n\\nWe early adopted Accounting Standards Update (“ASU”) No. 2020-06, “Debt with Conversion and Other Options (Subtopic 470-20) and Derivatives and Hedging—Contracts in Entity's Own Equity” (“ASU 2020-06”), to account for our Notes which eliminates the treasury stock method for convertible instruments that can be settled in whole or in part with equity and instead requires the application of the more dilutive of the “if-converted” method or the two-class method. Under the if-converted method, diluted earnings per share would generally be calculated assuming that all the conversion premium or spread were converted at the beginning of the reporting period, unless the result would be anti-dilutive. The conversion premium or spread would have a dilutive impact on net income per share when the average market price of the Company’s common stock for a given period exceeds the conversion price. \\n\\nThe capped call transactions may affect the value of the Notes and our common stock. \\n\\nIn connection with the Notes, we entered into privately negotiated capped call transactions with the option counterparties. The capped call transactions will cover, subject to customary adjustments, the number of shares of common stock that underlie the Notes. The capped call transactions are expected generally to reduce potential dilution to our common stock upon conversion of the Notes or at our election (subject to certain conditions) offset any cash payments we are required to make in excess of the aggregate principal amount of the converted Notes, as the case may be, with such reduction or offset subject to a cap. \\n\\nWe have been advised that, in connection with establishing their initial hedges of the capped call transactions, the option counterparties or their respective affiliates purchased shares of our common stock and/or entered into various derivative transactions with respect to our common stock. \\n\\nIn addition, we have been advised that the option counterparties or their respective affiliates may modify their hedge positions by entering into or unwinding various derivatives with respect to our common stock and/or purchasing or selling our common stock or other securities of ours in secondary market transactions following the pricing of the Notes and prior to the maturity of the Notes (and are likely to do so on each exercise date of the capped call transactions, and in connection with any early termination event in respect of the capped call transactions). This activity could also cause or avoid an increase or a decrease in the market price of our common stock. \\n\\nProvisions in the indenture governing the Notes could delay or prevent an otherwise beneficial takeover of us. \\n\\nCertain provisions in the Notes and the indenture governing the Notes could make a third party attempt to acquire us more difficult or expensive. For example, if a takeover constitutes a fundamental change, then noteholders will have the right to require us to repurchase their Notes for cash. In addition, if a takeover constitutes a Make-Whole Fundamental Change (as defined in the Indenture), then we may be required to temporarily increase the conversion rate. In either case, and in other cases, our obligations under the Notes and the indenture governing the Notes could increase the cost of acquiring us or otherwise discourage a third party from acquiring us or removing incumbent management, including in a transaction that holders of our common stock or Notes may view as favorable. \\n\\nWe may require additional financing to achieve our goals, and a failure to obtain this necessary capital when needed on acceptable terms, or at all, may force us to delay, limit, reduce or terminate our product manufacturing and development, and other operations. \\n\\nSince our inception, substantially all of our resources have been dedicated to the development of our three core plant-based product platforms of beef, pork and poultry, including purchases of property, plant and \\n\\nequipment, principally to support the development and production of our products, the build-out and equipping of our former Manhattan Beach Project Innovation Center and our Innovation Center within our Campus Headquarters, and the purchase, build-out and equipping of manufacturing facilities in the U.S. and abroad. We have and believe that we will continue to expend resources as we expand into additional markets we may choose to pursue. These expenditures are expected to include costs associated with research and development, manufacturing and supply, as well as marketing and selling existing and new products. In addition, other unanticipated costs may arise. \\n\\nAs of December 31, 2022, we had cash and cash equivalents and restricted cash of $322.5 million. Our operating plan may change because of factors currently unknown to us, and we may need to seek additional funds sooner than planned, through public or private equity or debt financings or other sources, including strategic collaborations. Such financing may result in dilution to stockholders, reduction in the market price of our common stock, imposition of debt covenants and repayment obligations, or other restrictions that may adversely affect our business. In addition, we may seek additional capital due to favorable market conditions or strategic considerations even if we believe we have sufficient funds for our current or future operating plans. However, the capital markets may experience extreme volatility and disruption, including rising interest rates and higher borrowing costs, which could make it more difficult for us to raise capital. If we cannot access the capital markets upon favorable terms or at all, it may impact our ability to achieve our goals. \\n\\nOur future capital requirements depend on many factors, including: \\n\\n• the number and characteristics of any additional products or manufacturing processes we develop or acquire to serve new or existing markets; \\n\\n• our investment in and build out of our Campus Headquarters; \\n\\n• the expenses associated with our marketing initiatives; \\n\\n• our investment in manufacturing and facilities to expand our manufacturing and production capacity; \\n\\n• our investments in real property and joint ventures; \\n\\n• the costs required to fund domestic and international operations and growth; \\n\\n• the scope, progress, results and costs of researching and developing future products or improvements to existing products or manufacturing processes; \\n\\n• any lawsuits related to our products or commenced against us or our directors and officers; \\n\\n• the expenses needed to attract and retain skilled personnel; \\n\\n• the costs associated with being a public company; \\n\\n• the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic, or any other pandemic, epidemic or other public health crisis; \\n\\n• the costs involved in preparing, filing, prosecuting, maintaining, defending and enforcing intellectual property claims, including litigation costs and the outcome of such litigation; and \\n\\n• the timing, receipt and amount of sales of, or royalties on, any future approved products, if any. \\n\\nAdditional funds may not be available when we need them, on terms that are acceptable to us, or at all. If adequate funds are not available to us on a timely basis, we may be required to: \\n\\n• delay, limit, reduce or terminate our manufacturing, research and development activities or our growth and expansion plans; or \\n\\n• delay, limit, reduce or terminate our establishment of sales and marketing capabilities or other activities that may be necessary to generate revenue and achieve profitability. \\n\\nOur inability to access and employ the cash that collateralizes our outstanding and future letters of credit may impact our liquidity. \\n\\nAs of December 31, 2022, we had restricted cash of $12.6 million securing the letter of credit to support the development and leasing of our Campus Headquarters. Our inability to access and employ the cash that collateralizes our outstanding and future letters of credit may impact our liquidity and could have an adverse impact on our business, operations and financial condition. \\n\\n\",\n",
       " '\\n\\nA major earthquake, tsunami, tornado, wildfire, flood, drought or other natural disaster or severe weather event could seriously disrupt our entire business. \\n\\nWe have offices, co-manufacturing and manufacturing facilities located in the United States and internationally. The impact of a major earthquake, tsunami, tornado, flood, wildfire, drought or other natural disaster or severe weather event at any of our facilities and overall operations is difficult to predict, but such a natural disaster or severe weather event could seriously disrupt our entire business and lead to substantial losses, which may not be covered by insurance. Additionally, to the extent such events become more frequent or intense, such as a result of climate change, it may adversely impact the cost or availability of such insurance. \\n\\nClimate change may negatively affect our business and operations. \\n\\nIncreasing concentrations of greenhouse gases in the atmosphere have generally been concluded to lead to increased ambient global temperatures, as well as changes in weather patterns and the frequency and severity of extreme weather and natural disasters. Adverse climate conditions, weather patterns and the impact of such conditions and patterns such as drought, flood, wildfires, mudslides and rising ambient temperatures adversely impact product cultivation conditions for farmers and agricultural productivity, including by disrupting ecosystems and severely altering the growing conditions, nutrient levels, soil moisture and water availability necessary for the growth and cultivation of crops, which would adversely affect the product quality, availability or cost of certain commodities that are necessary for our products, such as yellow peas, mung beans, sunflowers, rice, faba bean, canola oil and coconut oil. Many of our operations exist in water-stressed regions and water is a key ingredient in our products. Due to climate change, we may also be subjected to decreased availability of water, deteriorated quality of water or less favorable pricing for water, which could adversely impact our manufacturing and distribution operations. These and other changes to the physical environment may adversely impact our operations or those of the suppliers on whom we rely. While we may take various actions to mitigate our business risks associated with climate change, this may require us to incur substantial costs and may not be successful, due to, among other things, the uncertainty associated with the longer-term projections associated with managing climate risks. \\n\\n',\n",
       " '\\n\\nIf we fail to maintain proper and effective internal controls, our ability to produce accurate financial statements on a timely basis could be impaired, investors may lose confidence in our financial reporting and the trading price of our common stock may decline. \\n\\nEnsuring that we have adequate internal financial and accounting controls and procedures in place to produce accurate financial statements on a timely basis is a costly and time-consuming effort that needs to be re-evaluated frequently. We are in the process of upgrading our information technology systems and implementing additional financial and management controls, reporting systems and procedures in order to keep up with the requirements of being a reporting company under the Exchange Act. Additionally, the growth of our operations and our being a public company have created a need for additional resources within the accounting and finance functions due to the increasing need to produce timely financial information and to ensure the level of segregation of duties customary for a U.S. public company. We have hired additional resources in the accounting and finance functions and continue to reassess the sufficiency of finance personnel in response to these increasing demands and expectations. \\n\\nAs a public company, we are required to document and test our internal control over financial reporting pursuant to Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act so that our management can certify as to the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting. The rules governing the standards that must be met for management to assess our internal control over financial reporting are complex and require significant documentation, testing and possible remediation. We have and will continue to expend significant resources in developing the necessary documentation and testing procedures required by Section 404. We cannot be certain that the actions we have and will continue to take to improve our internal controls over financial reporting will be sufficient. \\n\\nAny failure to maintain internal control over financial reporting could severely inhibit our ability to accurately report our financial condition, results of operations or cash flows. If we are unable to conclude that our internal control over financial reporting is effective, or if our independent registered public accounting firm determines we have a material weakness or significant deficiency in our internal control over financial reporting, investors may lose confidence in the accuracy and completeness of our financial reports, the market price of our common stock could decline, and we could be subject to sanctions or investigations by NASDAQ, the SEC or other regulatory authorities. Failure to remedy any material weakness in our internal control over financial reporting, or to implement or maintain other effective control systems required of public companies, could also restrict our future access to the capital markets. \\n\\nOur disclosure controls and procedures may not prevent or detect all errors or acts of fraud. \\n\\nOur disclosure controls and procedures are designed to reasonably assure that information required to be disclosed by us in reports we file or submit under the Exchange Act is accumulated and communicated to management, recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time periods specified in the rules and forms of the SEC. We believe that any disclosure controls and procedures or internal controls and procedures, no matter how well conceived and operated, can provide only reasonable, not absolute, assurance that the objectives of the control system are met. \\n\\nThese inherent limitations include the realities that judgments in decision-making can be faulty, and that breakdowns can occur because of simple error or mistake. Additionally, controls can be circumvented by the individual acts of some persons, by collusion of two or more people or by an unauthorized override of the controls. Accordingly, because of the inherent limitations in our control system, misstatements or insufficient disclosures due to error or fraud may occur and not be detected. \\n\\nThe requirements of being a public company will require us to incur increased costs and may strain our resources, divert management’s attention and affect our ability to attract and retain qualified board members. \\n\\nAs a public company, we have incurred and will continue to incur significant legal, accounting and other expenses that we did not incur as a private company. We are subject to the reporting requirements of the Exchange Act which requires, among other things, that we file with the SEC annual, quarterly and current reports with respect to our business and financial condition. In addition, the Sarbanes-Oxley Act, as well as related rules adopted by the SEC and the Nasdaq Global Select Market, impose significant requirements on public companies, including requiring establishment and maintenance of effective disclosure and financial controls and changes in corporate governance practices. Further, we are required to comply with certain requirements of the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act, or the Dodd-Frank Act, as well as rules and regulations subsequently implemented by the SEC related to corporate governance and executive compensation, such as “say on pay” and proxy access. As such, we have and will continue to incur additional compliance-related expenses. Additionally, the SEC and other regulators have continued to adopt new rules and regulations and make additional changes to existing regulations that require our compliance. \\n\\nStockholder activism, the current political environment and the current high level of government intervention and regulatory reform may lead to substantial new regulations and disclosure obligations, which may lead to additional compliance costs and impact, in ways we cannot currently anticipate, the manner in which we operate our business. We expect the rules and regulations applicable to public companies to continue to increase our \\n\\nlegal and financial compliance costs and to make some activities more time-consuming and costly. If these requirements divert the attention of our management and personnel from other business concerns, they could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. The increased costs will decrease our net income or increase our net loss and may require us to reduce costs in other areas of our business. Furthermore, these rules and regulations could make it more difficult or more costly for us to obtain certain types of insurance, including director and officer liability insurance, and we may be forced to accept reduced policy limits and coverage and higher self-insured retention amounts, or incur substantially higher costs to obtain the same or similar coverage. The impact of these requirements could also make it more difficult for us to attract and retain qualified persons to serve on our board of directors, our board committees or as executive officers. We cannot predict or estimate the amount or timing of additional costs we may incur to respond to these requirements. \\n\\n',\n",
       " '\\n\\nOur operations are subject to FDA governmental regulation and other foreign, federal, state and local regulation, and there is no assurance that we will be in compliance with all regulations. \\n\\nOur operations are subject to extensive regulation by the FDA, and other foreign, federal, state and local authorities. Specifically, for products manufactured or sold in the United States we are subject to the requirements of the Federal Food, Drug and Cosmetic Act and regulations promulgated thereunder by the FDA. \\n\\nThis comprehensive regulatory program governs, among other things, the manufacturing, composition and ingredients, packaging, labeling and safety of food. Under this program, the FDA requires that facilities that manufacture food products comply with a range of requirements, including hazard analysis and preventive controls regulations, current good manufacturing practices (“cGMPs”), and supplier verification requirements. Comparable regulations apply in foreign jurisdictions such as the European Union, the United Kingdom and China. Our processing and manufacturing facilities, including those of our co-manufacturers, are subject to periodic inspection by foreign, federal, state and local authorities. We do not control the manufacturing processes of, and rely upon, our co-manufacturers for compliance with cGMPs for the manufacturing of our products by our co-manufacturers. If we or our co-manufacturers cannot successfully manufacture products that conform to our specifications and the strict regulatory requirements of the FDA or other non-U.S. regulators, we or they may be subject to adverse inspectional findings or enforcement actions, which could materially impact our ability to market our products, could result in our inability to manufacture our products or our co-manufacturers’ inability to continue manufacturing for us, or could result in a recall of our product that has already been distributed. In addition, we rely upon our co-manufacturers to maintain adequate quality control, quality assurance and qualified personnel. If the FDA or a comparable state, local or foreign regulatory authority determines that we or these co-manufacturers have not complied with the applicable regulatory requirements, our business may be materially impacted. \\n\\nWe seek to comply with applicable regulations through a combination of employing internal experience and expert personnel to ensure quality-assurance compliance (i.e., assuring that our products are not adulterated or misbranded) and contracting with third-party laboratories that conduct analyses of products to ensure compliance with nutrition labeling requirements and to identify any potential contaminants before distribution. Failure by us or our co-manufacturers to comply with applicable laws and regulations or maintain permits, licenses or registrations relating to our or our co-manufacturers’ operations could subject us to civil remedies or penalties, including fines, injunctions, recalls or seizures, warning letters, restrictions or prohibitions on the marketing or manufacturing of products, or refusals to permit the import or export of products, as well as potential criminal sanctions, which could result in increased operating costs resulting in a material effect on our operating results and business. \\n\\nWe are subject to international regulations that could adversely affect our business and results of operations. \\n\\nWe are subject to extensive regulations internationally where we manufacture, distribute and/or sell our products. Our products are subject to numerous food safety and other laws and regulations relating to the \\n\\nsourcing, manufacturing, composition and ingredients, storing, labeling, marketing, advertising and distribution of these products. For example, in early 2018, we received an inquiry from Canadian officials about the labeling and composition of products that we export to Canada. We responded promptly to that inquiry, identifying minor formulation changes that we made under Canadian regulations. If regulators determine that the labeling, advertising and/or composition of any of our products is not in compliance with foreign law or regulations, or if we or our co-manufacturers otherwise fail to comply with applicable laws and regulations in foreign jurisdictions where we operate and market products, we could be subject to civil remedies or penalties, such as fines, injunctions, recalls or seizures, warning letters, restrictions on the marketing or manufacturing of the products, or refusals to permit the import or export of products, as well as potential criminal sanctions. In places like Mainland China, government inquiries into product labeling and advertising can be prompted by random inspections of our product on the market by local government authorities or complaints by consumers or competitors to the authorities. The consequences of a labeling or advertising violation in China can lead not only to fines from administrative authorities but also to multiple individual consumer lawsuits for nominal damages in the hundreds of dollars each, which can be costly to defend. In addition, enforcement of existing laws and regulations, changes in legal requirements and/or evolving interpretations of existing regulatory requirements may result in increased compliance costs and create other obligations, financial or otherwise, that could adversely affect our business, financial condition or operating results. For example, China has recently introduced new regulations on food manufacturing and it may introduce new Food Labeling Supervision Measures that could increase restrictions and require changes to our labels. In addition, with our expanding international operations, we could be adversely affected by violations of the FCPA, and similar worldwide anti-bribery laws, which generally prohibit companies and their intermediaries from making improper payments to non-U.S. officials or other third parties for the purpose of obtaining or retaining business. While our policies mandate compliance with these anti-bribery laws, our internal control policies and procedures may not protect us from reckless or criminal acts committed by our employees, contractors or agents. Violations of these laws, or allegations of such violations, could disrupt our business and result in a material adverse effect on our results of operations, cash flows and financial condition. \\n\\nAny changes in, or changes in the interpretation of, applicable laws, regulations or policies of the FDA or U.S. Department of Agriculture, or USDA, state regulators or similar foreign regulatory authorities that relate to the use of the word “meat” or other similar words in connection with plant-based meat products could adversely affect our business, prospects, results of operations or financial condition. \\n\\nThe FDA and the USDA, state regulators or similar foreign regulatory authorities, such as Health Canada or the CFIA, or authorities of the U.K., the EU or the EU member states, or China, including the State Administration for Market Regulation and its local counterpart agencies, could take action to impact our ability to use the term “meat” or similar words (such as “beef,” “burger” or “sausage,” including the Beyond Meat logo of the Caped Longhorn superhero) to describe or advertise our products. In addition, a food may be deemed misbranded if its labeling is false or misleading in any particular way, and the FDA, CFIA, EU member state authorities or other regulators could interpret the use of the term “meat” or any similar phrase(s) to describe our plant-based meat products as false or misleading or likely to create an erroneous impression regarding their composition. \\n\\nFor example, in 2018, the state of Missouri passed a law prohibiting any person engaged in advertising, offering for sale, or sale of food products from misrepresenting a product as meat that is not derived from harvested production livestock or poultry. The state of Missouri Department of Agriculture has clarified its interpretation that products which include prominent disclosure that the product is “made from plants,” or comparable disclosure such as through the use of the phrase “plant-based,” are not misrepresented under the Missouri law. Additional states, including Arkansas, Georgia, Mississippi, Louisiana, Oklahoma, South Dakota and Wyoming, have subsequently passed similar laws, and legislation that would impose specific requirements on the naming of plant-based meat products is currently pending in a number of other states. The United States Congress recently considered (but did not pass) federal legislation, called the Real MEAT Act, that could require changes to our product labeling and marketing, including identifying products as “imitation” meat products, and that would give USDA certain oversight over the labeling of plant-based meat products. If similar bills gain traction and ultimately become law, we could be required to identify our products as “imitation” in our product \\n\\nlabels. Further, the FDA has announced that it is developing guidance on naming plant-based meat alternatives that could impact our naming expectations. Canadian Food and Drug Regulations also provide requirements for “simulated meat” products, including requirements around composition and naming. \\n\\nIn Europe, the Agriculture Committee of the European Parliament proposed in May 2019 to reserve the use of “meat” and meat-related terms and names for products that are manufactured from the edible parts of animals. In October 2020, the European Parliament rejected the adoption of this provision. In the absence of European Union legislation, Member States remain free to establish national restrictions on meat-related names. In June 2020, France adopted a law prohibiting names to indicate foodstuffs of animal origin to describe, market, or promote foodstuffs containing vegetable proteins. In October 2021, France published a draft implementing decree to define, for example, the sanctions in case of non-compliance with the new law. The Decree was published on June 29, 2022, and entered into force on October 1, 2022. We do not believe that the Decree complies with the laws of the European Union (EU), in particular the principle of free movement of goods. On July 27, 2022, at the request of a trade association, the French High Administrative Court partially suspended the execution of the Decree. This signals that there are indeed serious doubts as to the lawfulness of the Decree, though the suspension is only partial and temporary until the Court rules on the merits of the case. We understand that at least two more trade associations are also considering litigation. In this context, on October 21, 2022, the Company filed an application for annulment against the Decree. The Company also intervened in favor of the trade association in their pending case against the Decree on November 16, 2022. \\n\\nFrance is the first EU Member State to adopt such a law. Should other EU Member State regulatory authorities take action with respect to the use of the term “meat” or similar claims, such that we are unable to use those terms with respect to our plant-based products, we could be subject to enforcement action or recall of our products marketed with these terms, we may be required to modify our marketing strategy, or required to identify our products as “imitation” in our product labels, and our business, prospects, results of operations or financial condition could be adversely affected. \\n\\nIncreases in income tax rates or changes in income tax laws could have a material adverse impact on our financial results. \\n\\nIncreases in income tax rates or other changes in tax laws, including changes in how existing tax laws are interpreted or enforced, could adversely affect our financial performance. The increasingly complex global tax environment has in the past and could continue to increase tax uncertainty, resulting in higher compliance costs and adverse effects on our financial performance. We are also subject to regular reviews, examinations and audits by numerous taxing authorities with respect to income and non-income based taxes. Economic and political pressures to increase tax revenues in jurisdictions in which we operate, or the adoption of new or reformed tax legislation or regulation, may make resolving tax disputes more difficult and the final resolution of tax audits and any related litigation can differ from our historical provisions and accruals, resulting in an adverse effect on our financial performance. \\n\\nLitigation or legal proceedings could expose us to significant liabilities and have a negative impact on our reputation or business. \\n\\nFrom time to time, we may be party to various claims and litigation proceedings. We evaluate these claims and litigation proceedings to assess the likelihood of unfavorable outcomes and to estimate, if possible, the amount of potential losses. Based on these assessments and estimates, we may establish reserves, as appropriate. These assessments and estimates are based on the information available to management at the time and involve a significant amount of management judgment. Actual outcomes or losses may differ materially from our assessments and estimates. For information regarding pending legal proceedings, please see Part I, Item 3 , Legal Proceedings, and Note 1 0 , Commitments and Contingencies , to the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included elsewhere in this report. \\n\\nEven when not merited, the defense of these lawsuits may divert our management’s attention, and we may incur significant expenses in defending these lawsuits. The results of litigation and other legal proceedings are inherently uncertain, and adverse judgments or settlements in some of these legal disputes may result in \\n\\nadverse monetary damages, penalties or injunctive relief against us, which could have a material adverse effect on our financial position, cash flows or results of operations. Any claims or litigation, even if fully indemnified or insured, could damage our reputation and make it more difficult to compete effectively or to obtain adequate insurance in the future. \\n\\nFurthermore, while we maintain insurance for certain potential liabilities, such insurance does not cover all types and amounts of potential liabilities and is subject to self-insured retentions, various exclusions as well as caps on amounts recoverable. Even if we believe a claim is covered by insurance, insurers may dispute our entitlement to recovery for a variety of potential reasons, which may affect the timing and, if the insurers prevail, the amount of our recovery. \\n\\nGeneral Risk Factors \\n\\nOur share price has been and may continue to be highly volatile, and you could lose all or part of your investment. \\n\\nThe market price of our common stock has been and is likely to continue to be highly volatile and could be subject to wide fluctuations in response to many factors discussed in this “ Risk Factors ” section, including: \\n\\n• general economic, market and political conditions, including negative effects on consumer confidence and spending levels; \\n\\n• actual or anticipated fluctuations in our financial condition and operating results, including fluctuations in our quarterly and annual results; \\n\\n• announcements of innovations by us or our competitors; \\n\\n• announcement by competitors or new market entrants of their entry into or exit from the plant-based meat market; \\n\\n• overall conditions in our industry and the markets in which we operate; \\n\\n• market conditions or trends in the packaged food sales industry or in the economy as a whole; \\n\\n• addition or loss of significant customers or other developments with respect to significant customers; \\n\\n• adverse developments concerning our manufacturers or suppliers; \\n\\n• changes in laws or regulations applicable to our products or business; \\n\\n• our ability to effectively manage our growth and market expectations with respect to our growth; \\n\\n• speculation regarding public customer announcements or geographic expansion; \\n\\n• actual or anticipated changes in our growth rate relative to our competitors; \\n\\n• announcements by us or our competitors of significant acquisitions, strategic partnerships, joint ventures or capital commitments; \\n\\n• additions or departures of key personnel; \\n\\n• competition from existing products or new products that may emerge; \\n\\n• issuance of new or updated research or reports about us or our industry, or positive or negative recommendations or withdrawal of research coverage by securities analysts; \\n\\n• our failure to meet the estimates and projections of the investment community or that we may otherwise provide to the public; \\n\\n• fluctuations in the valuation of companies perceived by investors to be comparable to us; \\n\\n• disputes or other developments related to proprietary rights, including patents, and our ability to obtain intellectual property protection for our products; \\n\\n• litigation or regulatory matters; \\n\\n• announcement or expectation of additional financing efforts; \\n\\n• our cash position; \\n\\n• our indebtedness and ability to pay such indebtedness, as well as our ability to comply with covenants under our credit agreement; \\n\\n• sales of our common stock by our stockholders; \\n\\n• issuance of equity or debt; \\n\\n• share price and volume fluctuations attributable to inconsistent trading volume levels of our common stock; \\n\\n• changes in accounting practices; \\n\\n• ineffectiveness of our internal controls; \\n\\n• short-selling of our common stock; \\n\\n• negative media or marketing campaigns undertaken by our competitors or lobbyists supporting the meat industry; \\n\\n• the public’s response to publicity relating to the health aspects or nutritional value of our products; \\n\\n• the effects of COVID-19 and any other pandemic, epidemic or other public health crisis; and \\n\\n• other events or factors, many of which are beyond our control. \\n\\nFurthermore, the stock markets have experienced price and volume fluctuations that have affected and continue to affect the market prices of equity securities of many companies. These fluctuations often have been unrelated or disproportionate to the operating performance of those companies. These broad market and industry fluctuations, as well as general economic, political and market conditions such as recessions, interest rate changes, tariffs, international currency fluctuations, or the effects of disease outbreaks or pandemics (such as COVID-19), may negatively impact the market price of our common stock. In the past, companies that have experienced volatility in the market price of their stock have been subject to securities class action litigation. For example, in the past, we have been subject to multiple shareholder derivative lawsuits related, in part, to a securities case filed against us alleging federal securities law violations with respect to past disclosure, which case has since been dismissed with prejudice. Securities litigation, and any other type of litigation, brought against us could result in substantial costs and divert our management’s attention from other business concerns, which could seriously harm our business and adversely affect our results of operations. \\n\\nFuture sales of our common stock in the public market could cause our share price to fall. \\n\\nSales of a substantial number of shares of our common stock in the public market could occur at any time. These sales, or the perception in the market that the holders of a large number of shares of common stock intend to sell shares, could reduce the market price of our common stock. Moreover, certain holders of our common stock have rights, subject to certain conditions, to require us to file registration statements covering their shares or to include their shares in registration statements that we may file for ourselves or other stockholders. We also have registered all shares of common stock that we may issue under our equity compensation plans following the IPO or that are issuable upon exercise of outstanding options following the \\n\\nIPO. These shares can be freely sold in the public market upon issuance and once vested, subject to volume limitations applicable to affiliates. If any of these additional shares are sold, or if it is perceived that they will be sold, in the public market, the market price of our common stock could decline. \\n\\nIf securities or industry analysts issue an adverse or misleading opinion regarding our business or publish unfavorable research about our business, our share price and trading volume could decline. \\n\\nThe trading market for our common stock depends in part on the research and reports that industry or securities analysts publish about us or our business. If one or more of the analysts who cover us ceases coverage of our company or fails to publish reports on us regularly, we could lose visibility in the financial markets, which in turn could cause our share price or trading volume to decline. Moreover, if any of the analysts who cover us downgrade our stock or issue an adverse or misleading opinion regarding us, our business model or our stock performance, or if our operating results fail to meet the expectations of the investor community, our share price could decline. \\n\\nWe have never paid dividends on our capital stock and we do not intend to pay dividends for the foreseeable future. Consequently, any gains from an investment in our common stock will likely depend on whether the price of our common stock increases. \\n\\nWe have never declared or paid any dividends on our common stock and do not intend to pay any dividends in the foreseeable future. We anticipate that we will retain all of our future earnings for use in the operation of our business and for general corporate purposes. Accordingly, investors should rely on sales of their common stock after price appreciation, which may never occur, as the only way to realize any future gains on their investments. \\n\\nOur charter documents and Delaware law could prevent a takeover that stockholders consider favorable and could also reduce the market price of our stock. \\n\\nOur restated certificate of incorporation and our amended and restated bylaws contain provisions that could delay or prevent a change in control of our company. These provisions could also make it more difficult for stockholders to elect directors and take other corporate actions. These provisions include: \\n\\n• providing for a classified board of directors with staggered, three-year terms; \\n\\n• authorizing our board of directors to issue preferred stock with voting or other rights or preferences that could discourage a takeover attempt or delay changes in control; \\n\\n• prohibiting cumulative voting in the election of directors; \\n\\n• providing that vacancies on our board of directors may be filled only by a majority of directors then in office, even though less than a quorum; \\n\\n• prohibiting the adoption, amendment or repeal of our amended and restated bylaws or the repeal of the provisions of our restated certificate of incorporation regarding the election and removal of directors without the required approval of at least 66.67% of the shares entitled to vote at an election of directors; \\n\\n• prohibiting stockholder action by written consent; \\n\\n• limiting the persons who may call special meetings of stockholders; and \\n\\n• requiring advance notification of stockholder nominations and proposals, including without limitation, compliance with the requirements of Rule 14a-19 under the Exchange Act, as applicable. \\n\\nThese provisions may frustrate or prevent any attempts by our stockholders to replace or remove our current management by making it more difficult for stockholders to replace members of our board of directors, which is responsible for appointing the members of our management. In addition, the provisions of Section 203 of the Delaware General Corporate Law, or the DGCL, govern us. These provisions may prohibit large \\n\\nstockholders, in particular those owning 15% or more of our outstanding voting stock, from merging or combining with us for a certain period of time without the consent of our board of directors. \\n\\nThese and other provisions in our restated certificate of incorporation and our amended and restated bylaws and under Delaware law could discourage potential takeover attempts, reduce the price investors might be willing to pay in the future for shares of our common stock and result in the market price of our common stock being lower than it would be without these provisions. \\n\\nOur restated certificate of incorporation provides that the Court of Chancery of the State of Delaware and the federal district courts of the United States of America will be the exclusive forums for substantially all disputes between us and our stockholders, which could limit our stockholders’ ability to obtain a favorable judicial forum for disputes with us or our directors, officers, or employees. \\n\\nOur restated certificate of incorporation provides that the Court of Chancery of the State of Delaware is the exclusive forum for: \\n\\n• any derivative action or proceeding brought on our behalf; \\n\\n• any action asserting a claim of breach of a fiduciary duty owed by, or other wrongdoing by, any of our directors, officers, employees or agents to us or our stockholders; \\n\\n• any action asserting a claim against us arising pursuant to any provision of the DGCL, our restated certificate of incorporation, or our amended and restated bylaws; \\n\\n• any action to interpret, apply, enforce or determine the validity of our restated certificate of incorporation or our amended and restated bylaws; and \\n\\n• any action asserting a claim against us that is governed by the internal affairs doctrine; \\n\\nprovided, that with respect to any derivative action or proceeding brought on our behalf to enforce any liability or duty created by the Exchange Act or the rules and regulations thereunder, the exclusive forum will be the federal district courts of the United States of America. Our restated certificate of incorporation further provides that the federal district courts of the United States of America will be the exclusive forum for resolving any complaint asserting a cause of action arising under the Securities Act. \\n\\nThese exclusive forum provisions may limit a stockholder’s ability to bring a claim in a judicial forum that it finds favorable for disputes with us or our directors, officers, or other employees, which may discourage lawsuits against us and our directors, officers and other employees. \\n\\nOur ability to utilize our federal net operating loss and tax credit carryforwards may be limited under Sections 382 and 383 of the Internal Revenue Code (the “Code”). \\n\\nAs of December 31, 2022, we had accumulated federal, state and foreign net operating loss carryforwards of approximately $744.5 million, $314.2 million and $84.1 million, respectively. Approximately $652.7 million of the federal net operating losses and $84.9 million of the state net operating losses do not expire and the remaining federal, state and foreign tax loss carryforwards begin to expire in 2031, 2031 and 2025, respectively, unless previously utilized. Utilization of the Company’s net operating loss and tax credit carryforwards may be subject to a substantial annual limitation due to the ownership change limitations provided by the Code and similar state provisions. \\n\\nThe limitations apply if a corporation undergoes an “ownership change,” which is generally defined as a greater than 50 percentage point change (by value) in its equity ownership by certain stockholders over a three-year period. We have experienced several ownership changes none of which is expected to result in a material limitation on the future use of our net operating loss and credit carryforwards generated prior to these ownership changes. However, any future changes in our stock ownership, which may be outside of our control, may trigger an ownership change and, consequently, Section 382 and 383 limitations.

As a result, if we earn net taxable income, our ability to use our pre-change net operating loss carryforwards and other tax attributes to offset such taxable income may be subject to limitations, which could potentially result in increased future income tax liability to us. We are currently analyzing whether and to what extent we have experienced an ownership change pursuant to Section 382; and to the extent such change occurred, the impact to the availability of our tax attributes. \\n\\n']"

       "{'Risks Related to Regulatory and Legal Compliance Matters, Litigation and Legal Proceedings ': '\\n\\nOur operations are subject to FDA governmental regulation and other foreign, federal, state and local regulation, and there is no assurance that we will be in compliance with all regulations. \\n\\nOur operations are subject to extensive regulation by the FDA, and other foreign, federal, state and local authorities. Specifically, for products manufactured or sold in the United States we are subject to the requirements of the Federal Food, Drug and Cosmetic Act and regulations promulgated thereunder by the FDA. \\n\\nThis comprehensive regulatory program governs, among other things, the manufacturing, composition and ingredients, packaging, labeling and safety of food. Under this program, the FDA requires that facilities that manufacture food products comply with a range of requirements, including hazard analysis and preventive controls regulations, current good manufacturing practices (“cGMPs”), and supplier verification requirements. Comparable regulations apply in foreign jurisdictions such as the European Union, the United Kingdom and China. Our processing and manufacturing facilities, including those of our co-manufacturers, are subject to periodic inspection by foreign, federal, state and local authorities. We do not control the manufacturing processes of, and rely upon, our co-manufacturers for compliance with cGMPs for the manufacturing of our products by our co-manufacturers. If we or our co-manufacturers cannot successfully manufacture products that conform to our specifications and the strict regulatory requirements of the FDA or other non-U.S. regulators, we or they may be subject to adverse inspectional findings or enforcement actions, which could materially impact our ability to market our products, could result in our inability to manufacture our products or our co-manufacturers’ inability to continue manufacturing for us, or could result in a recall of our product that has already been distributed. In addition, we rely upon our co-manufacturers to maintain adequate quality control, quality assurance and qualified personnel. If the FDA or a comparable state, local or foreign regulatory authority determines that we or these co-manufacturers have not complied with the applicable regulatory requirements, our business may be materially impacted. \\n\\nWe seek to comply with applicable regulations through a combination of employing internal experience and expert personnel to ensure quality-assurance compliance (i.e., assuring that our products are not adulterated or misbranded) and contracting with third-party laboratories that conduct analyses of products to ensure compliance with nutrition labeling requirements and to identify any potential contaminants before distribution. Failure by us or our co-manufacturers to comply with applicable laws and regulations or maintain permits, licenses or registrations relating to our or our co-manufacturers’ operations could subject us to civil remedies or penalties, including fines, injunctions, recalls or seizures, warning letters, restrictions or prohibitions on the marketing or manufacturing of products, or refusals to permit the import or export of products, as well as potential criminal sanctions, which could result in increased operating costs resulting in a material effect on our operating results and business. \\n\\nWe are subject to international regulations that could adversely affect our business and results of operations. \\n\\nWe are subject to extensive regulations internationally where we manufacture, distribute and/or sell our products. Our products are subject to numerous food safety and other laws and regulations relating to the \\n\\nsourcing, manufacturing, composition and ingredients, storing, labeling, marketing, advertising and distribution of these products. For example, in early 2018, we received an inquiry from Canadian officials about the labeling and composition of products that we export to Canada. We responded promptly to that inquiry, identifying minor formulation changes that we made under Canadian regulations. If regulators determine that the labeling, advertising and/or composition of any of our products is not in compliance with foreign law or regulations, or if we or our co-manufacturers otherwise fail to comply with applicable laws and regulations in foreign jurisdictions where we operate and market products, we could be subject to civil remedies or penalties, such as fines, injunctions, recalls or seizures, warning letters, restrictions on the marketing or manufacturing of the products, or refusals to permit the import or export of products, as well as potential criminal sanctions. In places like Mainland China, government inquiries into product labeling and advertising can be prompted by random inspections of our product on the market by local government authorities or complaints by consumers or competitors to the authorities. The consequences of a labeling or advertising violation in China can lead not only to fines from administrative authorities but also to multiple individual consumer lawsuits for nominal damages in the hundreds of dollars each, which can be costly to defend. In addition, enforcement of existing laws and regulations, changes in legal requirements and/or evolving interpretations of existing regulatory requirements may result in increased compliance costs and create other obligations, financial or otherwise, that could adversely affect our business, financial condition or operating results. For example, China has recently introduced new regulations on food manufacturing and it may introduce new Food Labeling Supervision Measures that could increase restrictions and require changes to our labels. In addition, with our expanding international operations, we could be adversely affected by violations of the FCPA, and similar worldwide anti-bribery laws, which generally prohibit companies and their intermediaries from making improper payments to non-U.S. officials or other third parties for the purpose of obtaining or retaining business. While our policies mandate compliance with these anti-bribery laws, our internal control policies and procedures may not protect us from reckless or criminal acts committed by our employees, contractors or agents. Violations of these laws, or allegations of such violations, could disrupt our business and result in a material adverse effect on our results of operations, cash flows and financial condition. \\n\\nAny changes in, or changes in the interpretation of, applicable laws, regulations or policies of the FDA or U.S. Department of Agriculture, or USDA, state regulators or similar foreign regulatory authorities that relate to the use of the word “meat” or other similar words in connection with plant-based meat products could adversely affect our business, prospects, results of operations or financial condition. \\n\\nThe FDA and the USDA, state regulators or similar foreign regulatory authorities, such as Health Canada or the CFIA, or authorities of the U.K., the EU or the EU member states, or China, including the State Administration for Market Regulation and its local counterpart agencies, could take action to impact our ability to use the term “meat” or similar words (such as “beef,” “burger” or “sausage,” including the Beyond Meat logo of the Caped Longhorn superhero) to describe or advertise our products. In addition, a food may be deemed misbranded if its labeling is false or misleading in any particular way, and the FDA, CFIA, EU member state authorities or other regulators could interpret the use of the term “meat” or any similar phrase(s) to describe our plant-based meat products as false or misleading or likely to create an erroneous impression regarding their composition. \\n\\nFor example, in 2018, the state of Missouri passed a law prohibiting any person engaged in advertising, offering for sale, or sale of food products from misrepresenting a product as meat that is not derived from harvested production livestock or poultry. The state of Missouri Department of Agriculture has clarified its interpretation that products which include prominent disclosure that the product is “made from plants,” or comparable disclosure such as through the use of the phrase “plant-based,” are not misrepresented under the Missouri law. Additional states, including Arkansas, Georgia, Mississippi, Louisiana, Oklahoma, South Dakota and Wyoming, have subsequently passed similar laws, and legislation that would impose specific requirements on the naming of plant-based meat products is currently pending in a number of other states. The United States Congress recently considered (but did not pass) federal legislation, called the Real MEAT Act, that could require changes to our product labeling and marketing, including identifying products as “imitation” meat products, and that would give USDA certain oversight over the labeling of plant-based meat products. If similar bills gain traction and ultimately become law, we could be required to identify our products as “imitation” in our product \\n\\nlabels. Further, the FDA has announced that it is developing guidance on naming plant-based meat alternatives that could impact our naming expectations. Canadian Food and Drug Regulations also provide requirements for “simulated meat” products, including requirements around composition and naming. \\n\\nIn Europe, the Agriculture Committee of the European Parliament proposed in May 2019 to reserve the use of “meat” and meat-related terms and names for products that are manufactured from the edible parts of animals. In October 2020, the European Parliament rejected the adoption of this provision. In the absence of European Union legislation, Member States remain free to establish national restrictions on meat-related names. In June 2020, France adopted a law prohibiting names to indicate foodstuffs of animal origin to describe, market, or promote foodstuffs containing vegetable proteins. In October 2021, France published a draft implementing decree to define, for example, the sanctions in case of non-compliance with the new law. The Decree was published on June 29, 2022, and entered into force on October 1, 2022. We do not believe that the Decree complies with the laws of the European Union (EU), in particular the principle of free movement of goods. On July 27, 2022, at the request of a trade association, the French High Administrative Court partially suspended the execution of the Decree. This signals that there are indeed serious doubts as to the lawfulness of the Decree, though the suspension is only partial and temporary until the Court rules on the merits of the case. We understand that at least two more trade associations are also considering litigation. In this context, on October 21, 2022, the Company filed an application for annulment against the Decree. The Company also intervened in favor of the trade association in their pending case against the Decree on November 16, 2022. \\n\\nFrance is the first EU Member State to adopt such a law. Should other EU Member State regulatory authorities take action with respect to the use of the term “meat” or similar claims, such that we are unable to use those terms with respect to our plant-based products, we could be subject to enforcement action or recall of our products marketed with these terms, we may be required to modify our marketing strategy, or required to identify our products as “imitation” in our product labels, and our business, prospects, results of operations or financial condition could be adversely affected. \\n\\nIncreases in income tax rates or changes in income tax laws could have a material adverse impact on our financial results. \\n\\nIncreases in income tax rates or other changes in tax laws, including changes in how existing tax laws are interpreted or enforced, could adversely affect our financial performance. The increasingly complex global tax environment has in the past and could continue to increase tax uncertainty, resulting in higher compliance costs and adverse effects on our financial performance. We are also subject to regular reviews, examinations and audits by numerous taxing authorities with respect to income and non-income based taxes. Economic and political pressures to increase tax revenues in jurisdictions in which we operate, or the adoption of new or reformed tax legislation or regulation, may make resolving tax disputes more difficult and the final resolution of tax audits and any related litigation can differ from our historical provisions and accruals, resulting in an adverse effect on our financial performance. \\n\\nLitigation or legal proceedings could expose us to significant liabilities and have a negative impact on our reputation or business. \\n\\nFrom time to time, we may be party to various claims and litigation proceedings. We evaluate these claims and litigation proceedings to assess the likelihood of unfavorable outcomes and to estimate, if possible, the amount of potential losses. Based on these assessments and estimates, we may establish reserves, as appropriate. These assessments and estimates are based on the information available to management at the time and involve a significant amount of management judgment. Actual outcomes or losses may differ materially from our assessments and estimates. For information regarding pending legal proceedings, please see Part I, Item 3 , Legal Proceedings, and Note 1 0 , Commitments and Contingencies , to the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included elsewhere in this report. \\n\\nEven when not merited, the defense of these lawsuits may divert our management’s attention, and we may incur significant expenses in defending these lawsuits. The results of litigation and other legal proceedings are inherently uncertain, and adverse judgments or settlements in some of these legal disputes may result in \\n\\nadverse monetary damages, penalties or injunctive relief against us, which could have a material adverse effect on our financial position, cash flows or results of operations. Any claims or litigation, even if fully indemnified or insured, could damage our reputation and make it more difficult to compete effectively or to obtain adequate insurance in the future. \\n\\nFurthermore, while we maintain insurance for certain potential liabilities, such insurance does not cover all types and amounts of potential liabilities and is subject to self-insured retentions, various exclusions as well as caps on amounts recoverable. Even if we believe a claim is covered by insurance, insurers may dispute our entitlement to recovery for a variety of potential reasons, which may affect the timing and, if the insurers prevail, the amount of our recovery. \\n\\nGeneral Risk Factors \\n\\nOur share price has been and may continue to be highly volatile, and you could lose all or part of your investment. \\n\\nThe market price of our common stock has been and is likely to continue to be highly volatile and could be subject to wide fluctuations in response to many factors discussed in this “ Risk Factors ” section, including: \\n\\n• general economic, market and political conditions, including negative effects on consumer confidence and spending levels; \\n\\n• actual or anticipated fluctuations in our financial condition and operating results, including fluctuations in our quarterly and annual results; \\n\\n• announcements of innovations by us or our competitors; \\n\\n• announcement by competitors or new market entrants of their entry into or exit from the plant-based meat market; \\n\\n• overall conditions in our industry and the markets in which we operate; \\n\\n• market conditions or trends in the packaged food sales industry or in the economy as a whole; \\n\\n• addition or loss of significant customers or other developments with respect to significant customers; \\n\\n• adverse developments concerning our manufacturers or suppliers; \\n\\n• changes in laws or regulations applicable to our products or business; \\n\\n• our ability to effectively manage our growth and market expectations with respect to our growth; \\n\\n• speculation regarding public customer announcements or geographic expansion; \\n\\n• actual or anticipated changes in our growth rate relative to our competitors; \\n\\n• announcements by us or our competitors of significant acquisitions, strategic partnerships, joint ventures or capital commitments; \\n\\n• additions or departures of key personnel; \\n\\n• competition from existing products or new products that may emerge; \\n\\n• issuance of new or updated research or reports about us or our industry, or positive or negative recommendations or withdrawal of research coverage by securities analysts; \\n\\n• our failure to meet the estimates and projections of the investment community or that we may otherwise provide to the public; \\n\\n• fluctuations in the valuation of companies perceived by investors to be comparable to us; \\n\\n• disputes or other developments related to proprietary rights, including patents, and our ability to obtain intellectual property protection for our products; \\n\\n• litigation or regulatory matters; \\n\\n• announcement or expectation of additional financing efforts; \\n\\n• our cash position; \\n\\n• our indebtedness and ability to pay such indebtedness, as well as our ability to comply with covenants under our credit agreement; \\n\\n• sales of our common stock by our stockholders; \\n\\n• issuance of equity or debt; \\n\\n• share price and volume fluctuations attributable to inconsistent trading volume levels of our common stock; \\n\\n• changes in accounting practices; \\n\\n• ineffectiveness of our internal controls; \\n\\n• short-selling of our common stock; \\n\\n• negative media or marketing campaigns undertaken by our competitors or lobbyists supporting the meat industry; \\n\\n• the public’s response to publicity relating to the health aspects or nutritional value of our products; \\n\\n• the effects of COVID-19 and any other pandemic, epidemic or other public health crisis; and \\n\\n• other events or factors, many of which are beyond our control. \\n\\nFurthermore, the stock markets have experienced price and volume fluctuations that have affected and continue to affect the market prices of equity securities of many companies. These fluctuations often have been unrelated or disproportionate to the operating performance of those companies. These broad market and industry fluctuations, as well as general economic, political and market conditions such as recessions, interest rate changes, tariffs, international currency fluctuations, or the effects of disease outbreaks or pandemics (such as COVID-19), may negatively impact the market price of our common stock. In the past, companies that have experienced volatility in the market price of their stock have been subject to securities class action litigation. For example, in the past, we have been subject to multiple shareholder derivative lawsuits related, in part, to a securities case filed against us alleging federal securities law violations with respect to past disclosure, which case has since been dismissed with prejudice. Securities litigation, and any other type of litigation, brought against us could result in substantial costs and divert our management’s attention from other business concerns, which could seriously harm our business and adversely affect our results of operations. \\n\\nFuture sales of our common stock in the public market could cause our share price to fall. \\n\\nSales of a substantial number of shares of our common stock in the public market could occur at any time. These sales, or the perception in the market that the holders of a large number of shares of common stock intend to sell shares, could reduce the market price of our common stock. Moreover, certain holders of our common stock have rights, subject to certain conditions, to require us to file registration statements covering their shares or to include their shares in registration statements that we may file for ourselves or other stockholders. We also have registered all shares of common stock that we may issue under our equity compensation plans following the IPO or that are issuable upon exercise of outstanding options following the \\n\\nIPO. These shares can be freely sold in the public market upon issuance and once vested, subject to volume limitations applicable to affiliates. If any of these additional shares are sold, or if it is perceived that they will be sold, in the public market, the market price of our common stock could decline. \\n\\nIf securities or industry analysts issue an adverse or misleading opinion regarding our business or publish unfavorable research about our business, our share price and trading volume could decline. \\n\\nThe trading market for our common stock depends in part on the research and reports that industry or securities analysts publish about us or our business. If one or more of the analysts who cover us ceases coverage of our company or fails to publish reports on us regularly, we could lose visibility in the financial markets, which in turn could cause our share price or trading volume to decline. Moreover, if any of the analysts who cover us downgrade our stock or issue an adverse or misleading opinion regarding us, our business model or our stock performance, or if our operating results fail to meet the expectations of the investor community, our share price could decline. \\n\\nWe have never paid dividends on our capital stock and we do not intend to pay dividends for the foreseeable future. Consequently, any gains from an investment in our common stock will likely depend on whether the price of our common stock increases. \\n\\nWe have never declared or paid any dividends on our common stock and do not intend to pay any dividends in the foreseeable future. We anticipate that we will retain all of our future earnings for use in the operation of our business and for general corporate purposes. Accordingly, investors should rely on sales of their common stock after price appreciation, which may never occur, as the only way to realize any future gains on their investments. \\n\\nOur charter documents and Delaware law could prevent a takeover that stockholders consider favorable and could also reduce the market price of our stock. \\n\\nOur restated certificate of incorporation and our amended and restated bylaws contain provisions that could delay or prevent a change in control of our company. These provisions could also make it more difficult for stockholders to elect directors and take other corporate actions. These provisions include: \\n\\n• providing for a classified board of directors with staggered, three-year terms; \\n\\n• authorizing our board of directors to issue preferred stock with voting or other rights or preferences that could discourage a takeover attempt or delay changes in control; \\n\\n• prohibiting cumulative voting in the election of directors; \\n\\n• providing that vacancies on our board of directors may be filled only by a majority of directors then in office, even though less than a quorum; \\n\\n• prohibiting the adoption, amendment or repeal of our amended and restated bylaws or the repeal of the provisions of our restated certificate of incorporation regarding the election and removal of directors without the required approval of at least 66.67% of the shares entitled to vote at an election of directors; \\n\\n• prohibiting stockholder action by written consent; \\n\\n• limiting the persons who may call special meetings of stockholders; and \\n\\n• requiring advance notification of stockholder nominations and proposals, including without limitation, compliance with the requirements of Rule 14a-19 under the Exchange Act, as applicable. \\n\\nThese provisions may frustrate or prevent any attempts by our stockholders to replace or remove our current management by making it more difficult for stockholders to replace members of our board of directors, which is responsible for appointing the members of our management. In addition, the provisions of Section 203 of the Delaware General Corporate Law, or the DGCL, govern us. These provisions may prohibit large \\n\\nstockholders, in particular those owning 15% or more of our outstanding voting stock, from merging or combining with us for a certain period of time without the consent of our board of directors. \\n\\nThese and other provisions in our restated certificate of incorporation and our amended and restated bylaws and under Delaware law could discourage potential takeover attempts, reduce the price investors might be willing to pay in the future for shares of our common stock and result in the market price of our common stock being lower than it would be without these provisions. \\n\\nOur restated certificate of incorporation provides that the Court of Chancery of the State of Delaware and the federal district courts of the United States of America will be the exclusive forums for substantially all disputes between us and our stockholders, which could limit our stockholders’ ability to obtain a favorable judicial forum for disputes with us or our directors, officers, or employees. \\n\\nOur restated certificate of incorporation provides that the Court of Chancery of the State of Delaware is the exclusive forum for: \\n\\n• any derivative action or proceeding brought on our behalf; \\n\\n• any action asserting a claim of breach of a fiduciary duty owed by, or other wrongdoing by, any of our directors, officers, employees or agents to us or our stockholders; \\n\\n• any action asserting a claim against us arising pursuant to any provision of the DGCL, our restated certificate of incorporation, or our amended and restated bylaws; \\n\\n• any action to interpret, apply, enforce or determine the validity of our restated certificate of incorporation or our amended and restated bylaws; and \\n\\n• any action asserting a claim against us that is governed by the internal affairs doctrine; \\n\\nprovided, that with respect to any derivative action or proceeding brought on our behalf to enforce any liability or duty created by the Exchange Act or the rules and regulations thereunder, the exclusive forum will be the federal district courts of the United States of America. Our restated certificate of incorporation further provides that the federal district courts of the United States of America will be the exclusive forum for resolving any complaint asserting a cause of action arising under the Securities Act. \\n\\nThese exclusive forum provisions may limit a stockholder’s ability to bring a claim in a judicial forum that it finds favorable for disputes with us or our directors, officers, or other employees, which may discourage lawsuits against us and our directors, officers and other employees. \\n\\nOur ability to utilize our federal net operating loss and tax credit carryforwards may be limited under Sections 382 and 383 of the Internal Revenue Code (the “Code”). \\n\\nAs of December 31, 2022, we had accumulated federal, state and foreign net operating loss carryforwards of approximately $744.5 million, $314.2 million and $84.1 million, respectively. Approximately $652.7 million of the federal net operating losses and $84.9 million of the state net operating losses do not expire and the remaining federal, state and foreign tax loss carryforwards begin to expire in 2031, 2031 and 2025, respectively, unless previously utilized.

      "acquisitions: [\" How We Addressed the Matter in Our Audit We obtained an understanding, evaluated the design and tested the operating effectiveness of controls that address the risks of material misstatement over the Company’s process to estimate the fair value of the Finlandia brand name, including controls over management’s review of the selection of assumptions, described above, used in the valuation model. To test the estimated fair value of the Company’s Finlandia brand name, we performed audit procedures that included, among others, assessing methodologies used in the valuation model and testing the significant assumptions discussed above. This included comparing the significant assumptions used by management to observable market data, current industry and economic trends, changes in the Company’s business model and customer base, historical operating results, and other relevant factors that would affect the significant assumptions. We assessed management’s historical estimates and performed sensitivity analyses of assumptions to evaluate the changes in the fair value of the Finlandia brand name that would result from changes in the assumptions. We also involved valuation specialists to assist in evaluating valuation methodologies and certain assumptions used in the model. Valuation of Intangible Assets for Gin Mare and Diplomático Description of the Matter During 2023, the Company completed its acquisition of Diplomático for consideration of $727 million in cash and its acquisition of Gin Mare for consideration of $468 million in cash paid at the acquisition date plus contingent consideration of $56 million, as disclosed in Note 12 to the consolidated financial statements. The transactions were accounted for as business combinations. Auditing the Company's accounting for its acquisitions of Diplomático and Gin Mare was complex due to the significant judgement required in the Company’s determination of the preliminary fair value of identified intangible assets of $312 million for Diplomático and $307 million for Gin Mare, which primarily consisted of brand names and trademarks (“acquired brand names”). The preliminary fair value estimates were sensitive to significant assumptions used in the valuation process, such as future net sales and discount rates. The estimates also included assumptions such as royalty rates. How We Addressed the Matter in Our Audit We obtained an understanding, evaluated the design and tested the operating effectiveness of controls that address the risks of material misstatement over the Company’s process to estimate the preliminary fair value of the acquired brand names, including controls over management’s review of the selection of assumptions, described above, used in the valuation models. To test the estimated preliminary fair values of the acquired brand names, we performed audit procedures that included, among others, assessing methodologies used in the valuation models and testing the significant assumptions discussed above. This included comparing the significant assumptions used by management to observable market data, current industry and economic trends, historical operating results of similar brands and other relevant factors that would affect the significant assumptions. We performed sensitivity analyses of certain assumptions to evaluate the changes in the preliminary fair value of the acquired brand names that would result from changes in the assumptions. We also involved valuation specialists to assist in evaluating valuation methodologies and certain assumptions used in the models. \", '/s/ Ernst & Young LLP We have served as the Company’s auditor since 2020. Louisville, Kentucky June 16, 2023 Report of Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm To the Stockholders and the Board of Directors of Brown-Forman Corporation Opinion on Internal Control Over Financial Reporting We have audited Brown-Forman Corporation and Subsidiaries’ internal control over financial reporting as of April 30, 2023, based on criteria established in Internal Control—Integrated Framework issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (2013 framework), (the COSO criteria). In our opinion, Brown-Forman Corporation and Subsidiaries (the Company) maintained, in all material respects, effective internal control over financial reporting as of April 30, 2023, based on the COSO criteria. As indicated in the accompanying Management’s Report on Internal Control over Financial Reporting, management’s assessment of and conclusion on the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting did not include the internal controls of Gin Mare or Diplomático, which are included in the 2023 consolidated financial statements of the Company and constituted 2% of total assets as of April 30, 2023, excluding goodwill and intangibles, and less than 1% of net sales for the year then ended. Our audit of internal control over financial reporting of the Company also did not include an evaluation of the internal control over financial reporting of Gin Mare or Diplomático. We also have audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States) (PCAOB), the consolidated balance sheets of the Company as of April 30, 2023 and 2022, the related consolidated statements of operations, comprehensive income, stockholders’ equity and cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended April 30, 2023, and the related notes and financial statement schedule listed in the Index at Item 15(a)(2) and our report dated June 16, 2023 expressed an unqualified opinion thereon. Basis for Opinion The Company’s management is responsible for maintaining effective internal control over financial reporting and for its assessment of the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting included in the accompanying Management’s Report on Internal Control over Financial Reporting. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the Company’s internal control over financial reporting based on our audit. We are a public accounting firm registered with the PCAOB and are required to be independent with respect to the Company in accordance with the U.S. federal securities laws and the applicable rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB. We conducted our audit in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether effective internal control over financial reporting was maintained in all material respects. Our audit included obtaining an understanding of internal control over financial reporting, assessing the risk that a material weakness exists, testing and evaluating the design and operating effectiveness of internal control based on the assessed risk, and performing such other procedures as we considered necessary in the circumstances. We believe that our audit provides a reasonable basis for our opinion. Definition and Limitations of Internal Control Over Financial Reporting ', 'A company’s internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. A company’s internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that (1) pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company; (2) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the company; and (3) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the company’s assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements. ', \"Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate. /s/ Ernst & Young LLP Louisville, Kentucky June 16, 2023 Brown-Forman Corporation and Subsidiaries Consolidated Statements of Operations (Dollars in millions, except per share amounts)   Year Ended April 30, 2021 2022 2023 Sales $ 4,526  $ 5,081  $ 5,372  Excise taxes 1,065  1,148  1,144  Net sales 3,461  3,933  4,228  Cost of sales 1,367  1,542  1,734  Gross profit 2,094  2,391  2,494  Advertising expenses 399  438  506  Selling, general, and administrative expenses 671  690  742  Gain on sale of business ( 127 ) —  —  Other expense (income), net ( 15 ) 59  119  Operating income 1,166  1,204  1,127  Non-operating postretirement expense 6  13  29  Interest income ( 2 ) ( 5 ) ( 9 ) Interest expense 81  82  90  Income before income taxes 1,081  1,114  1,017  Income taxes 178  276  234  Net income $ 903  $ 838  $ 783  Earnings per share: Basic $ 1.89  $ 1.75  $ 1.63  Diluted $ 1.88  $ 1.74  $ 1.63   The accompanying notes are an integral part of the consolidated financial statements.

Brown-Forman Corporation and Subsidiaries Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements (Dollars and other currency amounts in millions, except per share data)  1. Accounting Policies We prepare our consolidated financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States (GAAP). We also apply the following accounting policies when preparing our consolidated financial statements: Principles of consolidation. Our consolidated financial statements include the accounts of all subsidiaries in which we have a controlling financial interest. We eliminate all intercompany transactions. Estimates. To prepare financial statements that conform with GAAP, our management must make informed estimates that affect how we report revenues, expenses, assets, and liabilities, including contingent assets and liabilities. Actual results could differ from these estimates. Cash equivalents. Cash equivalents include bank demand deposits and all highly liquid investments with original maturities of three months or less. Accounts receivable. Accounts receivable are recorded net of an allowance for expected credit losses (allowance for doubtful accounts). We determine the allowance using information such as customer credit history and financial condition, historical loss experience, and macroeconomic factors. We write off account balances against the allowance when we have exhausted our collection efforts. The allowance for doubtful accounts was $ 13 and $ 7 at April 30, 2022 and 2023, respectively. Inventories. Inventories are valued at the lower of cost or net realizable value. Approximately 49 % of our consolidated inventories are valued using the last-in, first-out (LIFO) cost method, which we use for the majority of our U.S. inventories. We value the remainder of our inventories primarily using the first-in, first-out (FIFO) cost method. FIFO cost approximates current replacement cost. If we had used the FIFO method for all inventories, they would have been $ 385 and $ 429 higher than reported at April 30, 2022 and 2023, respectively. Because we age most of our whiskeys in barrels for three years or more, we bottle and sell only a portion of our whiskey inventory each year. Following industry practice, we classify all barreled whiskey as a current asset. We include warehousing, insurance, ad valorem taxes, and other carrying charges applicable to barreled whiskey in inventory costs. We classify agave inventories, bulk tequila, bulk wine, and liquid in bottling tanks as work in process. Property, plant, and equipment. We state property, plant, and equipment at cost less accumulated depreciation. We calculate depreciation on a straight-line basis using our estimates of useful life, which are 20 – 40 years for buildings and improvements; 3 – 10 years for machinery, equipment, vehicles, furniture, and fixtures; and 3 – 7 years for capitalized software. We assess our property, plant, and equipment for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value of those assets may not be recoverable. When we do not expect to recover the carrying value of an asset (or asset group) through undiscounted future cash flows, we write it down to its estimated fair value. We determine fair value using discounted estimated future cash flows, considering market values for similar assets when available. When we retire or dispose of property, plant, and equipment, we remove its cost and accumulated depreciation from our balance sheet and reflect any gain or loss in operating income. We expense the costs of repairing and maintaining our property, plant, and equipment as we incur them. Goodwill and other intangible assets. When we acquire a business, we first allocate the purchase price to identifiable assets and liabilities, including intangible brand names and trademarks (“brand names”), based on estimated fair value. We then record any remaining purchase price as goodwill. We do not amortize goodwill or other intangible assets with indefinite lives. We consider all of our brand names to have indefinite lives. We assess our goodwill and other indefinite-lived intangible assets for impairment at least annually, or more frequently if circumstances indicate the carrying amount may be impaired. Goodwill is impaired when the carrying amount of the related reporting unit exceeds its estimated fair value, in which case we write down the goodwill by the amount of the excess (limited to the carrying amount of the goodwill). We estimate the reporting unit's fair value using discounted estimated future cash flows or market information. Similarly, a brand name is impaired when its carrying amount exceeds its estimated fair value, in which case we write down the brand name to its estimated fair value. We estimate the fair value of a brand name using the relief-from-royalty method. We also consider market values for similar assets when available. Considerable management judgment is necessary to estimate fair value, including the selection of assumptions about future cash flows, net sales, discount rates, and royalty rates. We have the option, before quantifying the fair value of a reporting unit or brand name, to evaluate qualitative factors to assess whether it is more likely than not that our goodwill or brand names are impaired. If we determine that is not the case, then we are not required to quantify the fair value. That assessment also takes considerable management judgment. Revenue recognition. Our net sales predominantly reflect global sales of beverage alcohol consumer products. We sell these products under contracts with different types of customers, depending on the market. The customer is most often a distributor, wholesaler, or retailer. Each contract typically includes a single performance obligation to transfer control of the products to the customer. Depending on the contract, control is transferred when the products are either shipped or delivered to the customer, at which point we recognize the transaction price for those products as net sales. The transaction price recognized at that point reflects our estimate of the consideration to be received in exchange for the products. The actual amount may ultimately differ due to the effect of various customer incentives and trade promotion activities. In making our estimates, we consider our historical experience and current expectations, as applicable. Subsequent adjustments recognized for changes in estimated transaction prices are typically not material. Net sales exclude taxes we collect from customers that are imposed by various governments on our sales, and are reduced by payments to customers unless made in exchange for distinct goods or services with fair values approximating the payments. Net sales include any amounts we bill customers for shipping and handling activities related to the products. We recognize the cost of those activities in cost of sales during the same period in which we recognize the related net sales. Sales returns, which are permitted only in limited situations, are not material. Customer payment terms generally range from 30 to 90 days. There are no significant amounts of contract assets or liabilities. Cost of sales. Cost of sales includes the costs of receiving, producing, inspecting, warehousing, insuring, and shipping goods sold during the period. Advertising costs. We expense the production costs of advertising when the advertisements first take place. We expense all other advertising costs during the year in which the costs are incurred. Selling, general, and administrative expenses. Selling, general, and administrative expenses include the costs associated with our sales force, administrative staff and facilities, and other expenses related to our non-manufacturing functions. Stock-based compensation. We use stock-based awards as part of our incentive compensation for eligible employees and directors. We recognize the grant-date fair value of an award as compensation expense on a straight-line basis over the requisite service period, which typically corresponds to the vesting period for the award. Upon forfeiture of an award prior to vesting, we reverse any previously recognized compensation expense related to that award. We classify stock-based compensation expense within selling, general, and administrative expenses. As we recognize compensation expense for a stock-based award, we concurrently recognize a related deferred tax asset. The subsequent vesting or exercise of the award will generally result in an actual tax benefit that differs from the deferred tax asset that had been recorded. The excess (deficiency) of the actual tax benefit over (under) the previously recorded tax asset is recognized as income tax benefit (expense) on the date of vesting or exercise. Income taxes. We base our annual provision for income taxes on the pre-tax income reflected in our consolidated statement of operations. We establish deferred tax liabilities or assets for temporary differences between GAAP and tax reporting bases and later adjust them to reflect changes in tax rates expected to be in effect when the temporary differences reverse. We record a valuation allowance as necessary to reduce a deferred tax asset to the amount that we believe is more likely than not to be realized. We do not provide deferred income taxes on undistributed earnings of foreign subsidiaries that we expect to indefinitely reinvest. We record a deferred tax charge in prepaid taxes for the difference between GAAP and tax reporting bases with respect to the elimination of intercompany profit in ending inventory. We assess our uncertain income tax positions in two steps. First, we evaluate whether the tax position will more likely than not, based on its technical merits, be sustained upon examination, including resolution of any related appeals or litigation. For a tax position that does not meet this first criterion, we recognize no tax benefit. For a tax position that does meet the first criterion, we recognize a tax benefit in an amount equal to the largest amount of benefit that we believe has more than a 50% likelihood of being realized upon ultimate resolution. We record interest and penalties on uncertain tax positions as income tax expense. Foreign currency transactions and translation. We report all gains and losses from foreign currency transactions (those denominated in a currency other than the entity's functional currency) in current income. The U.S. dollar is the functional currency for most of our consolidated entities. The local currency is the functional currency for some of our consolidated foreign entities. We translate the financial statements of those foreign entities into U.S. dollars, using the exchange rate in effect at the balance sheet date to translate assets and liabilities, and using the average exchange rate for the reporting period to translate income and expenses. We record the resulting translation adjustments in other comprehensive income (loss). 2. Balance Sheet Information Supplemental information on our year-end balance sheets is as follows:  April 30, 2022 2023 Other current assets: Prepaid taxes $ 155  $ 122  Other 122  167  $ 277  $ 289  Property, plant, and equipment: Land $ 86  $ 97  Buildings 660  717  Equipment 849  889  Construction in process 129  217  1,724  1,920  Less accumulated depreciation 849  889  $ 875  $ 1,031  Accounts payable and accrued expenses: Accounts payable, trade $ 218  $ 308  Accrued expenses: Advertising, promotion, and discounts 200  216  Compensation and commissions 99  106  Excise and other non-income taxes 74  76  Other 112  121  485  519  $ 703  $ 827  Other liabilities: Contingent consideration (Note 12) $ —  $ 56  Other 181  197  $ 181  $ 253  Accumulated other comprehensive income (loss), net of tax: Currency translation adjustments $ ( 239 ) $ ( 104 ) Cash flow hedge adjustments 37  10  Postretirement benefits adjustments ( 150 ) ( 141 ) $ ( 352 ) $ ( 235 ) 3. Earnings per Share We calculate basic earnings per share by dividing net income available to common stockholders by the weighted average number of common shares outstanding during the period. Diluted earnings per share further includes the dilutive effect of stock-based compensation awards. We calculate that dilutive effect using the “treasury stock method” (as defined by GAAP). The following table presents information concerning basic and diluted earnings per share:   2021 2022 2023 Net income available to common stockholders $ 903  $ 838  $ 783  Share data (in thousands): Basic average common shares outstanding 478,527  478,879  479,155  Dilutive effect of stock-based awards 2,150  1,686  1,310  Diluted average common shares outstanding 480,677  480,565  480,465  Basic earnings per share $ 1.89  $ 1.75  $ 1.63  Diluted earnings per share $ 1.88  $ 1.74  $ 1.63  We excluded common stock-based awards for approximately 234,000 shares, 691,000 shares, and 1,107,000 shares from the calculation of diluted earnings per share for 2021, 2022, and 2023, respectively, because they were not dilutive for those periods under the treasury stock method. 4. Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets The following table shows the changes in goodwill (which include no accumulated impairment losses) and other intangible assets over the past two years:   Goodwill Other Intangible Assets Balance as of April 30, 2021 $ 779  $ 676  Foreign currency translation adjustment ( 18 ) ( 38 ) Impairment —  ( 52 ) Balance as of April 30, 2022 761  586  Acquisitions (Note 12) 652  619  Foreign currency translation adjustment 44  55  Impairment —  ( 96 ) Balance as of April 30, 2023 $ 1,457  $ 1,164  Our other intangible assets consist of trademarks and brand names, all with indefinite useful lives. During fiscal 2022, we recognized a non-cash impairment charge of $ 52 for the Finlandia brand name. The impairment reflected a decline in our long-term outlook for Finlandia due to our suspension of operations in Russia, a key market for the brand. During fiscal 2023, we recognized an additional non-cash impairment charge of $ 96 for the Finlandia brand name, largely reflecting the effects of higher discount rates and input costs on its valuation. The impairment charges are included in “other expense (income), net” in the accompanying consolidated statements of operations. As of April 30, 2023, the remaining carrying amount of the Finlandia brand name was $ 91 . 5. Contingencies We operate in a litigious environment, and we are sued in the normal course of business. Sometimes plaintiffs seek substantial damages. Significant judgment is required in predicting the outcome of these suits and claims, many of which take years to adjudicate. We accrue estimated costs for a contingency when we believe that a loss is probable and we can make a reasonable estimate of the loss, and then adjust the accrual as appropriate to reflect changes in facts and circumstances. We do not believe it is reasonably possible that these existing loss contingencies, individually or in the aggregate, would have a material adverse effect on our financial position, results of operations, or liquidity. No material accrued loss contingencies are recorded as of April 30, 2023. 6. Debt and Credit Facilities Our long-term debt (net of unamortized discounts and issuance costs) consisted of:  April 30, 2022 2023 2.25 % senior notes, $ 250 principal amount, due January 15, 2023 $ 250  $ —  3.50 % senior notes, $ 300 principal amount, due April 15, 2025 298  299  1.20 % senior notes, € 300 principal amount, due July 7, 2026 315  330  2.60 % senior notes, £ 300 principal amount, due July 7, 2028 374  375  4.75 % senior notes, $ 650 principal amount, due April 15, 2033 —  642  4.00 % senior notes, $ 300 principal amount, due April 15, 2038 295  295  3.75 % senior notes, $ 250 principal amount, due January 15, 2043 248  248  4.50 % senior notes, $ 500 principal amount, due July 15, 2045 489  489  2,269  2,678  Less current portion 250  —  $ 2,019  $ 2,678  On January 3, 2023, we entered into a $ 600 senior unsecured 364-day term loan credit agreement with various U.S. and international banks. This credit agreement specified a variable interest rate reflecting the Secured Overnight Financing Rate applicable to the term of the particular borrowing plus a margin based on our credit ratings. The weighted-average interest rate on the term loan borrowings was 5.36 % until it was repaid in full on March 23, 2023. On January 15, 2023, we repaid the $ 250 principal amount of 2.25 % senior notes that matured on that date. On March 23, 2023, we issued senior unsecured notes with an aggregate principal amount of $ 650 . Interest on these notes will accrue at a rate of 4.75 % and be paid semi-annually. These notes will mature on April 15, 2033. The net proceeds from the issuance were used to repay $ 600 of outstanding indebtedness under the unsecured 364-day term loan agreement, dated January 3, 2023. Debt payments required over the next five fiscal years consist of $ 0 in 2024, $ 300 in 2025, $ 0 in 2026, $ 331 in 2027, $ 0 in 2028, and $ 2,077 after 2028. The senior notes contain terms, events of default, and covenants customary of these types of unsecured securities, including limitations on the amount of secured debt we can issue. Our short-term borrowings were $235 as of April 30, 2023 under our commercial paper program. There were no borrowings under that program as of April 30, 2022.  April 30, 2022 2023 Commercial paper $ — $ 235 Average interest rate — % 5.17 % Average remaining days to maturity 0 21  We had a committed revolving credit agreement with various U.S. and international banks for $ 800 that was scheduled to expire in November 2024. At April 30, 2023, there were no borrowings outstanding under this facility. On May 26, 2023, we entered into an amended and restated five-year credit agreement with various U.S. and international banks that provides for a $ 900 unsecured revolving credit commitment and expires on May 26, 2028. This agreement amended and restated our previous credit facility agreement. The new agreement contains no financial covenants. 7.

Pension and Other Postretirement Benefits We sponsor various defined benefit pension plans as well as postretirement plans providing retiree health care and retiree life insurance benefits. Below, we discuss our obligations related to these plans, the assets dedicated to meeting the obligations, and the amounts we recognized in our financial statements as a result of sponsoring these plans.  Obligations. We provide eligible employees with pension and other postretirement benefits based on factors such as years of service and compensation level during employment. The pension obligation shown below (“projected benefit obligation”) consists of: (a) benefits earned by employees to date based on current salary levels (“accumulated benefit obligation”); and (b) benefits to be received by employees as a result of expected future salary increases. (The obligation for medical and life insurance benefits is not affected by future salary increases.) The following table shows how the present value of our projected benefit obligations changed during each of the last two years.    Pension Benefits Medical and Life Insurance Benefits  2022 2023 2022 2023 Obligation at beginning of year $ 1,012  $ 846  $ 49  $ 43  Service cost 26  20  1  1  Interest cost 22  32  1  1  Net actuarial loss (gain) 1 ( 132 ) ( 21 ) ( 5 ) ( 2 ) Retiree contributions —  —  1  2  Benefits paid ( 82 ) ( 146 ) ( 4 ) ( 5 ) Obligation at end of year $ 846  $ 731  $ 43  $ 40   1 The net actuarial loss (gain) during each year was primarily attributable to changes in discount rates . Service cost represents the present value of the benefits attributed to service rendered by employees during the year. Interest cost is the increase in the present value of the obligation due to the passage of time. Net actuarial loss (gain) is the change in value of the obligation resulting from experience different from that assumed or from a change in an actuarial assumption. (We discuss actuarial assumptions used at the end of this note.) Plan amendments may also change the value of the obligation. As shown in the previous table, the change in the value of our pension and other postretirement benefit obligations also includes the effect of benefit payments and retiree contributions. Expected benefit payments (net of retiree contributions) over the next 10 years are as follows:  Pension Benefits Medical and Life Insurance Benefits 2024 $ 53  $ 4  2025 52  3  2026 54  3  2027 55  3  2028 56  3  2029 – 2033 287  15   Assets. We invest in specific assets to fund our pension benefit obligations. Our investment goal is to earn a total return that, over time, will grow assets sufficiently to fund our plans' liabilities, after providing appropriate levels of contributions and accepting prudent levels of investment risk. To achieve this goal, plan assets are invested primarily in funds or portfolios of funds managed by outside managers. Investment risk is managed by company policies that require diversification of asset classes, manager styles, and individual holdings. We measure and monitor investment risk through quarterly and annual performance reviews, and through periodic asset/liability studies. Asset allocation is the most important method for achieving our investment goals and is based on our assessment of the plans' long-term return objectives and the appropriate balances needed for liquidity, stability, and diversification. As of April 30, 2023, our target asset allocation is a mix of 31 % public equity investments, 58 % fixed income investments, and 11 % alternative investments. The following table shows the fair value of pension plan assets by category as of the end of the last two years. (Fair value levels are defined in Note 14.)

The valuation requires significant judgment due to the absence of quoted market prices and the inherent lack of liquidity. This limited partnership has a term expiring in September 2023. 2 Commingled trust fund valuations are based on the NAV of the funds as determined by the fund administrators and reviewed by us. NAV represents the underlying assets owned by the fund, minus liabilities and divided by the number of shares or units outstanding. Generally, for commingled trust funds other than real estate, redemptions are permitted daily with no notice period. The real estate fund is redeemable quarterly with 110 days ' notice. 3 These limited partnership interests were initially valued at cost and have been adjusted using NAV per audited financial statements. Investments are generally not eligible for immediate redemption and have original terms averaging 10 to 13 years, although those periods may be extended. The following table shows how the fair value of the Level 3 assets changed during each of the last two years. There were no transfers of assets between Level 3 and either of the other two levels.

Funded status. The funded status of a plan refers to the difference between its assets and its obligations. The following table shows the funded status of our plans.

Pension cost. The following table shows the components of the pension cost recognized during each of the last three years. The amount for each year includes amortization of the prior service cost/credit and net actuarial loss/gain included in accumulated other comprehensive loss as of the beginning of the year.    Pension Benefits  2021 2022 2023 Service cost $ 26  $ 26  $ 20  Interest cost 25  22  32  Expected return on assets ( 46 ) ( 45 ) ( 43 ) Amortization of: Prior service cost (credit) 1  1  1  Net actuarial loss (gain) 27  23  9  Settlement charge —  12  29  Net cost $ 33  $ 39  $ 48   We determine the expected return on plan assets by applying our long-term rate of return assumption to the market-related value of plan assets, adjusted by earnings on contributions and benefit payments expected to be made during the year. We calculate the market-related value of plan assets by amortizing actual versus expected returns over five years. We amortize prior service costs and net actuarial gains or losses on straight-line basis over the average remaining service period of the employees expected to receive benefits under the plan. However, for net actuarial gains or losses, we use a corridor approach that amortizes them only to the extent the gain or loss exceeds 10% of the greater of the projected benefit obligation or market-related value of plan assets. The settlement charges recognized during 2022 and 2023 were triggered by fiscal year-to-date lump-sum payments under certain pension plans surpassing total annual service and interest cost for those plans. Other postretirement benefits cost. The following table shows the components of the postretirement medical and life insurance benefits cost that we recognized during each of the last three years.    Medical and Life Insurance Benefits  2021 2022 2023 Service cost $ 1  $ 1  $ 1  Interest cost 1  1  1  Amortization of: Prior service cost (credit) ( 3 ) ( 2 ) —  Net actuarial loss (gain) 1  1  —  Net cost $ —  $ 1  $ 2   We amortize prior service costs and net actuarial gains or losses on straight-line basis over the average remaining service period of the employees expected to receive benefits under the plan. Other comprehensive income (loss). Prior service cost/credit and net actuarial loss/gain are recognized in other comprehensive income or loss (OCI) during the period in which they arise. These amounts are later amortized from accumulated OCI into pension and other postretirement benefit cost over future periods as described above. The following table shows the pre-tax effect of these amounts on OCI during each of the last three years.   Pension Benefits Medical and Life Insurance Benefits  2021 2022 2023 2021 2022 2023 Net actuarial gain (loss) $ 69  $ 62  $ ( 29 ) $ 1  $ 5  $ 2  Amortization reclassified to earnings: Prior service cost (credit) 1  1  1  ( 3 ) ( 2 ) —  Net actuarial loss (gain) 27  35  38  1  1  —  Net amount recognized in OCI $ 97  $ 98  $ 10  $ ( 1 ) $ 4  $ 2   Assumptions and sensitivity. We use various assumptions to determine the obligations and cost related to our pension and other postretirement benefit plans. The weighted-average assumptions used in computing benefit plan obligations as of the end of the last two years were as follows:   Pension Benefits Medical and Life Insurance Benefits  2022 2023 2022 2023 Discount rate 4.36  % 4.91  % 4.33  % 4.86  % Rate of salary increase 4.00  % 4.00  % n/a n/a Interest crediting rate 3.06  % 3.69  % n/a n/a   The weighted-average assumptions used in computing benefit plan cost during each of the last three years were as follows:    Pension Benefits Medical and Life Insurance Benefits  2021 2022 2023 2021 2022 2023 Discount rate for service cost 3.49 % 3.36  % 4.52  % 3.59 % 3.49  % 4.50  % Discount rate for interest cost 2.56 % 2.34  % 4.12  % 2.47 % 2.27  % 3.96  % Rate of salary increase 4.00 % 4.00  % 4.00  % n/a n/a n/a Interest crediting rate 3.07 % 3.06  % 3.06  % n/a n/a n/a Expected return on plan assets 6.50 % 6.25  % 6.25  % n/a n/a n/a The assumed discount rates are determined using a yield curve based on the interest rates of high-quality debt securities with maturities corresponding to the expected timing of our benefit payments. The service cost and interest cost components are measured by applying the specific spot rates along the yield curve used to measure the benefit obligation at the beginning of the period. The assumed rate of salary increase reflects the expected average annual increase in salaries as a result of inflation, merit increases, and promotions over the service period of the plan participants. The assumed interest crediting is based on the greater of the average yield on 30-year Treasury bonds or the minimum rate specified in the applicable pension plan. The expected return on plan assets represents the long-term rate of return that we assume will be earned over the life of the pension assets. The assumption reflects expected capital market returns for each asset class, which are based on historical returns, adjusted for the expected effects of diversification. The assumed health care cost trend rates as of the end of the last two years were as follows:    Medical and Life Insurance Benefits  2022 2023 Health care cost trend rate assumed for next year 6.10  % 7.23  % Rate to which the cost trend rate is assumed to decline (the ultimate trend rate) 4.50  % 4.50  % Year that the rate reaches the ultimate trend rate 2030 2032 Savings plans. We also sponsor various defined contribution benefit plans that together cover substantially all U.S. employees. Employees can make voluntary contributions in accordance with their respective plans, which include a 401(k) tax deferral option. We match a percentage of each employee's contributions in accordance with plan terms. We expensed $ 12 , $ 13 , and $ 14 for matching contributions during 2021, 2022, and 2023, respectively. International plans. The information presented above for defined benefit plans and defined contribution benefit plans reflects amounts for U.S. plans only. Information about similar international plans is not presented due to immateriality. 10. Stock-Based Compensation The Brown-Forman 2022 Omnibus Compensation Plan (Plan) is our incentive compensation plan, designed to reward participants (including eligible officers, employees, and non-employee directors) for company performance. Under the Plan, we can grant stock-based incentive awards for up to 12,412,433 shares of common stock to eligible participants until July 28, 2032. As of April 30, 2023, awards for approximately 11,844,000 shares remain available for issuance under the Plan. We try to limit the source of shares delivered to participants under the Plan to treasury shares that we purchase from time to time on the open market (in connection with a publicly announced share repurchase program), in private transactions, or otherwise. Awards granted under the Plan include stock-settled stock appreciation rights (SSARs), performance-based restricted stock units (PBRSUs), and deferred stock units (DSUs). SSARs. We grant SSARs at an exercise price equal to the closing market price of the underlying stock on the grant date. SSARs become exercisable after three years from the first day of the fiscal year of grant and generally are exercisable for seven years after that date. The following table presents information about SSARs outstanding as of April 30, 2023, and for the year then ended.  Number of SSARs (in thousands) Weighted- Average Exercise Price per SSAR Weighted- Average Remaining Contractual Term (years) Aggregate Intrinsic Value Outstanding at April 30, 2022 4,232  $ 47.54  Granted 387  73.61  Exercised ( 579 ) 34.58  Forfeited or expired ( 30 ) 70.63  Outstanding at April 30, 2023 4,010  $ 51.76  4.8 $ 60  Exercisable at April 30, 2023 2,758  $ 43.23  3.5 $ 60   We use the Black-Scholes pricing model to calculate the grant-date fair value of a SSAR. The weighted-average grant-date fair values and related valuation assumptions for the SSARS granted during each of the last three years were as follows:  2021 2022 2023 Grant-date fair value $ 14.61  $ 16.61  $ 20.67  Valuation assumptions: Expected term (years) 7.0 7.0 7.0 Risk-free interest rate 0.4 % 1.0  % 2.7  % Expected volatility 23.3 % 24.1  % 24.8  % Expected dividend yield 1.0 % 1.0  % 1.0  %  The expected term is based on past exercise experience for similar awards. The risk-free interest rate is based on zero-coupon U.S. Treasury rates as of the date of grant. Expected volatility and dividend yield are based on historical data, with consideration of other factors when applicable. PBRSUs. The PBRSUs vest at the end of a three-year performance period that begins on the first day of the fiscal year of grant. Performance is measured by comparing the three-year cumulative total shareholder return of our Class B common stock to the three-year cumulative total shareholder return of the companies in the Standard & Poor's Consumer Staples Index, with specific payout levels ranging from 50% to 150%. At the end of the performance period, the number of PBRSUs is adjusted for performance, and then adjusted upward to account for dividends paid during the second and third years of the performance period. The resulting PBRSUs are then converted to common shares. The following table presents information about PBRSUs outstanding as of April 30, 2023, and for the year then ended.  Number of PBRSUs (in thousands) Weighted- Average Fair Value at Grant Date Outstanding at April 30, 2022 270  $ 67.02  Granted 110  $ 84.75  Adjusted for performance and dividends ( 14 ) $ 56.98  Converted to common shares ( 70 ) $ 56.98  Forfeited ( 7 ) $ 82.42  Outstanding at April 30, 2023 289  $ 76.33  We calculate the grant-date fair value of a PBRSU using a Monte Carlo simulation technique. The weighted average grant-date fair values and related valuation assumptions for these awards granted during each of the last three years were as follows:  2021 2022 2023 Grant-date fair value $ 73.68  $ 70.11  $ 84.75  Valuation assumptions: Risk-free interest rate 0.1  % 0.3  % 2.8  % Expected volatility 29.9  % 29.1  % 29.8  % Expected dividend yield 1.1  % 1.0  % 1.0  % Remaining performance period (years) as of grant date 2.8 2.8 2.8  DSUs. DSUs are granted to our non-employee directors. Each DSU represents the right to receive one share of common stock based on the closing price of the shares on the date of grant. Outstanding DSUs are credited with dividend-equivalent DSUs when dividends are paid on our common stock. Each annual grant vests after one year. DSUs are paid out in shares after the completion of a director's tenure on the board plus a six-month waiting period. The director may elect to receive the distribution either in a single lump sum or in ten equal annual installments. As of April 30, 2023, there were approximately 185,000 outstanding DSUs, of which approximately 168,000 were vested. The grant-date fair value of a DSU is the closing market price of the underlying stock on the grant date. The weighted average grant-date fair values for these awards granted during each of the last three years were as follows:  2021 2022 2023 Grant-date fair value $ 63.01  $ 67.35  $ 72.10   Additional information. The pre-tax stock-based compensation expense and related deferred income tax benefits recognized during the last three fiscal years were as follows:  2021 2022 2023 Pre-tax compensation expense $ 12  $ 15  $ 18  Deferred tax benefit 2  2  3   As of April 30, 2023, there was $ 9 of total unrecognized compensation cost related to non-vested stock-based awards. That cost is expected to be recognized over a weighted-average period of 1.4 years. Further information related to our stock-based awards for the last three years is as follows:  2021 2022 2023 Intrinsic value of SSARs exercised $ 47  $ 23  $ 19  Fair value of shares vested 13  7  6  Excess tax benefit from exercise / vesting of awards 10  6  4   11. Income Taxes We incur income taxes on the earnings of our U.S. and foreign operations. The following table, based on the locations of the taxable entities from which sales were derived (rather than the location of customers), presents the U.S. and foreign components of our income before income taxes:  2021 2022 2023 United States $ 832  $ 954  $ 841  Foreign 249  160  176  $ 1,081  $ 1,114  $ 1,017   The income shown above was determined according to GAAP. Because those standards sometimes differ from the tax rules used to calculate taxable income, there are differences between (a) the amount of taxable income and pretax financial income for a year, and (b) the tax bases of assets or liabilities and their amounts as recorded in our financial statements. As a result, we recognize a current tax liability for the estimated income tax payable on the current tax return, deferred tax liabilities (tax on income that will be recognized on future tax returns), and deferred tax assets (tax from deductions that will be recognized on future tax returns) for the estimated effects of the differences mentioned above. Total income tax expense for a year includes the tax associated with the current tax return (current tax expense) and the change in the net deferred tax asset or liability (deferred tax expense). Our total income tax expense for each of the last three years was as follows:  2021 2022 2023 Current: U.S. federal $ 146  $ 205  $ 157  Foreign 50  64  46  State and local 35  18  34  231  287  237  Deferred: U.S. federal ( 4 ) 1  ( 4 ) Foreign ( 47 ) ( 9 ) 6  State and local ( 2 ) ( 3 ) ( 5 ) ( 53 ) ( 11 ) ( 3 ) $ 178  $ 276  $ 234   Our consolidated effective tax rate usually differs from current statutory rates due to the recognition of amounts for events or transactions with no tax consequences. The following table reconciles our effective tax rate to the federal statutory tax rate in the United States:    Percent of Income Before Taxes  2021 2022 2023 U.S. federal statutory rate 21.0  % 21.0  % 21.0  % State taxes, net of U.S. federal tax benefit 2.4  % 1.0  % 2.5  % Income taxed at other than U.S. federal statutory rate 0.3  % 1.3  % 3.0  % Prior intercompany sales taxed at higher than current U.S. federal statutory rate 0.2  % 2.0  % 1.0  % Tax benefit from foreign-derived sales ( 1.7  %) ( 1.8  %) ( 3.0 ) % Adjustments related to prior years ( 0.2  %) 0.7  % ( 0.5 ) % Excess tax benefits from stock-based awards ( 1.0  %) ( 0.5  %) ( 0.3 ) % Tax rate changes —  % 0.4  % —  % Intercompany transfer of assets ( 4.0  %) —  % —  % Valuation allowance —  % —  % ( 1.3 ) % Other, net ( 0.5  %) 0.7  % 0.6  % Effective rate 16.5  % 24.8  % 23.0  %  Deferred tax assets and liabilities as of the end of each of the last two years were as follows:  April 30, 2022 2023 Deferred tax assets: Postretirement and other benefits $ 69  $ 75  Accrued liabilities and other 36  35  Inventories 40  26  Lease liabilities 20  23  Loss and credit carryforwards 69  62  Total deferred tax assets 234  221  Valuation allowance ( 27 ) ( 14 ) Total deferred tax assets, net of valuation allowance 207  207  Deferred tax liabilities: Intangible assets ( 219 ) ( 323 ) Property, plant, and equipment ( 87 ) ( 98 ) Right-of-use assets ( 20 ) ( 23 ) Derivative instruments ( 11 ) ( 3 ) Other ( 15 ) ( 17 ) Total deferred tax liabilities ( 352 ) ( 464 ) Net deferred tax liability $ ( 145 ) $ ( 257 ) Details of the loss and credit carryforwards and related valuation allowances as of the end of each of the last two years are as follows:  April 30, 2022 April 30, 2023 Gross Amount Deferred Tax Asset Valuation Allowance Gross Amount Deferred Tax Asset Valuation Allowance U.S. $ 53  $ 19  $ ( 8 ) $ 111  $ 20  $ ( 6 ) Foreign 241  50  ( 19 ) 216  42  ( 8 ) $ 294  $ 69  $ ( 27 ) $ 327  $ 62  $ ( 14 )  1 As of April 30, 2023, the deferred tax asset amount includes credit carryforwards of $ 10 that d o not expire and loss and credit carryforwards of $ 10 that expire in varying amounts from 2023 to 2039. 2 As of April 30, 2023, the deferred tax asset includes loss carryforwards of $ 19 that do no t expire and $ 23 that expire in va rying amounts over the next 10 years. As of April 30, 2023, we had approximately $ 1,617 of undistributed earnings from our foreign subsidiaries ($ 1,446 at April 30, 2022). These earnings have been previously subject to tax, primarily as a result of the 2017 Tax Cuts and Jobs Act. Historically, we have asserted that the undistributed earnings of our foreign subsidiaries are reinvested indefinitely outside the United States. We continue to maintain indefinite reinvestment assertions for most undistributed earnings of our foreign subsidiaries, and no deferred taxes have been provided on the earnings. For undistributed earnings not considered permanently reinvested, deferred tax liabilities have been provided for any applicable income taxes and withholding taxes payable in various countries, which are not significant. We have also asserted that other outside basis differences related to our foreign subsidiaries are reinvested indefinitely and that the determination of any unrecognized deferred tax liabilities is not practicable due to the complexities in the calculations. The other outside basis differences relate primarily to differences between U.S. GAAP and tax basis that arose through purchase accounting. These basis differences could reverse through sales of foreign subsidiaries or other transactions, none of which are considered probable as of April 30, 2023. At April 30, 2023, we had $ 21 of gross unrecognized tax benefits, $ 17 of which would reduce our effective income tax rate if recognized. A reconciliation of the beginning and ending unrecognized tax benefits follows:   2021 2022 2023 Unrecognized tax benefits at beginning of year $ 11  $ 12  $ 14  Additions for tax positions provided in prior periods 1  2  8  Additions for tax positions provided in current period 2  2  3  Settlements of tax positions in the current period ( 1 ) —  —  Lapse of statutes of limitations ( 1 ) ( 2 ) ( 4 ) Unrecognized tax benefits at end of year $ 12  $ 14  $ 21   We file federal income tax returns in the United States and also file tax returns in various state, local and foreign jurisdictions. The major jurisdictions where we are subject to examination by tax authorities include the United States, Australia, Brazil, Germany, Korea, Mexico, Netherlands, Poland and the United Kingdom. We have tax years open for examination from 2013 and forward. Various tax examinations are currently in progress in the United States, for both federal and states, and in certain foreign jurisdictions. In the United States, we are participating in the Internal Revenue Service's Compliance Assurance Program for our fiscal 2023 tax year. We believe there will be no material change in our gross unrecognized tax benefits in the next 12 months. 12. Acquisitions and Divestitures \", 'Acquisitions . As discussed below, we completed two acquisitions during fiscal 2023. Each acquisition was accounted for as a business combination. ', 'On November 3, 2022, we acquired the Gin Mare and Gin Mare Capri brands through our purchase of 100 % of the equity interests of Gin Mare Brand, S.L.U., a Spanish company, and Mareliquid Vantguard, S.L.U., a Spanish company (the “Gin Mare acquisition”). The purchase price of the Gin Mare acquisition was $ 524 , which consisted of $ 468 in cash paid at the acquisition date plus contingent consideration of $ 56 . We have preliminarily allocated the purchase price based on management’s estimates and independent valuations as follows:  Initial Allocation 1 Adjustments Updated Allocation Trademarks and brand names (indefinite-lived) $ 308  $ ( 1 ) $ 307  Goodwill 288  1  289  Total assets 596  —  596  Deferred tax liabilities 72  —  72  Net assets acquired $ 524  $ —  $ 524  1 As reported in Note 14 to our condensed consolidated financial statements in our Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q for the quarter ended January 31, 2023. ', 'The contingent consideration of $ 56 reflects the estimated fair value, at the acquisition date, of contingent future cash payments of up to € 90 to the sellers under an “earn-out” provision of the acquisition agreement. We determined the estimated fair value of the contingent consideration using a Monte Carlo simulation, which requires the use of assumptions, such as projected future net sales, discount rates, and volatility rates. ', 'Any contingent consideration earned by the sellers will be payable in cash no earlier than July 2024 and no later than July 2027, depending on when the sellers choose to exercise the right to receive the payment. The amount payable will depend on the achievement of net sales targets for Gin Mare for the latest fiscal year completed prior to the date of exercise by the sellers. The possible payments range from zero to € 90 (approximately $ 89 as of the acquisition date). ', 'At the acquisition date, we also entered into a supply agreement with the sellers for the production and supply of Gin Mare products to us, at market terms, for an initial period of 10 years (subject to subsequent renewal periods). ', 'On January 5, 2023, we acquired the Diplomático and Botucal rum brands through our purchase of (i) 100 % of the equity interests of (a) International Rum and Spirits Distributors Unipessoal, Lda., a Portuguese company, (b) Diplomático Branding Unipessoal Lda., a Portuguese company, (c) International Bottling Services, S.A., a Panamanian corporation, and (d) International Rum & Spirits Marketing Solutions, S.L., a Spanish company; and (ii) certain assets of Destilerias Unidas Corp. (the “Diplomático acquisition”). The purchase price of the Diplomático acquisition consisted of cash of $ 727 . We have preliminarily allocated the purchase price based on management’s estimates and independent valuations as follows:  Initial Allocation 1 Adjustments Updated Allocation Accounts receivable $ 11  $ —  $ 11  Inventories 33  3  36  Other current assets 25  —  25  Property, plant, and equipment 36  2  38  Trademarks and brand names (indefinite-lived) 312  —  312  Goodwill 365  ( 2 ) 363  Other assets —  2  2  Total assets 782  5  787  Accounts payable and accrued expenses 10  3  13  Deferred tax liabilities 45  —  45  Other liabilities —  2  2  Total liabilities 55  5  60  Net assets acquired $ 727  $ —  $ 727  1 As reported in Note 14 to our condensed consolidated financial statements in our Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q for the quarter ended January 31, 2023. ', 'At the acquisition date, we also entered into a supply agreement with the sellers for their production and supply of rum to us, at market terms, for an initial period of 10 years (subject to subsequent renewal periods). ', 'We allocated the purchase price for each acquisition based on preliminary estimates, which we may revise as asset valuations are finalized and we obtain further information on the fair value of liabilities. The primary matters to be finalized consist of the valuation of certain tangible assets and identifiable intangible assets, any related tax effects, and any resulting impact on residual goodwill. ', 'The amounts preliminarily allocated to trademarks and brand names for each acquisition were estimated using the relief-from-royalty method, which requires the use of significant assumptions, such as discount rates and projected future net sales. ', 'Goodwill is calculated as the excess of the purchase price over the fair value of the net identifiable assets acquired. The goodwill recorded for each acquisition is primarily attributable to the value of leveraging our distribution network and brand-building expertise to grow sales of the acquired brands. For the Gin Mare acquisition, we expect none of the preliminary goodwill of $ 289 to be deductible for tax purposes. For the Diplomático acquisition, we expect $ 109 of the preliminary goodwill of $ 363 to be deductible for tax purposes. ', 'Results for Gin Mare and Diplomático have been included in our consolidated financial statements since their acquisition dates. Pro forma results are not presented as the aggregate impact is not material to our consolidated statements of operations. ', 'In connection with the acquisitions, we recognized transaction expenses of $ 55 during fiscal 2023. The following table shows the classification of the transaction expenses in the accompanying consolidated statement of operations.  2023 Selling, general, and administrative expenses $ 11  Other expense (income), net 44  Total transaction expenses $ 55   The transaction expenses largely reflect payments made to terminate certain distribution contracts related to the acquired brands. Divestiture. On July 31, 2020, we sold the Early Times, Canadian Mist, and Collingwood brands for $ 177 in cash. The sale reflects the continued evolution of our portfolio strategy to focus on premium spirits brands. The total book value of the related business assets included in the sale was $ 50 , consisting largely of inventories, the Canadian Mist production assets, and intellectual property. As a result of the sale, we recognized a pre-tax gain of $ 127 during fiscal 2021. 13. Derivative Financial Instruments and Hedging Activities We are subject to market risks, including the effect of fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates, commodity prices, and interest rates. We use derivatives to help manage financial exposures that occur in the normal course of business. We formally document the purpose of each derivative contract, which includes linking the contract to the financial exposure it is designed to mitigate. We do not hold or issue derivatives for trading or speculative purposes. We use currency derivative contracts to limit our exposure to the foreign currency exchange risk that we cannot mitigate internally by using netting strategies. We designate most of these contracts as cash flow hedges of forecasted transactions (expected to occur within three years). We record all changes in the fair value of cash flow hedges in accumulated other comprehensive income (AOCI) until the underlying hedged transaction occurs, when we reclassify that amount into earnings. Some of our currency derivatives are not designated as hedges because we use them to partially offset the immediate earnings impact of changes in foreign currency exchange rates on existing assets or liabilities. We immediately recognize the change in fair value of these contracts in earnings. We had outstanding currency derivatives, related primarily to our euro, British pound, and Australian dollar exposures, with notional amounts for all hedged currencies totaling $ 801 and $ 747 at April 30, 2022 and 2023, respectively. The maximum term of outstanding derivative contracts was 36 months and 24 months at April 30, 2022 and 2023, respectively. We also use foreign currency-denominated debt to help manage our foreign currency exchange risk. We designate a portion of those debt instruments as net investment hedges, which are intended to mitigate foreign currency exposure related to non-U.S.-dollar net investments in certain foreign subsidiaries. Any change in value of the designated portion of the hedging instruments is recorded in AOCI, offsetting the foreign currency translation adjustment of the related net investments that is also recorded in AOCI. The amount of foreign currency-denominated debt designated as net investment hedges was $ 636 and $ 495 as of April 30, 2022 and 2023, respectively. At inception, we expect each financial instrument designated as a hedge to be highly effective in offsetting the financial exposure it is designed to mitigate, and we assess hedge-effectiveness continually. If we determine that an instrument is no longer highly effective, we stop designating and accounting for it as a hedge. We use forward purchase contracts with suppliers to protect against corn price volatility. We expect to take physical delivery of the corn underlying each contract and use it for production over a reasonable period of time. Accordingly, we account for these contracts as normal purchases rather than as derivative instruments. In the fourth quarter of fiscal 2023, we entered into $ 350 of interest rate derivative contracts (U.S. Treasury lock agreements) to manage the interest rate risk related to the anticipated issuance of fixed-rate senior unsecured notes. We designated the contracts as cash flow hedges of the future interest payments associated with the anticipated notes. Upon issuance of the 4.75 % senior notes in March 2023 (see Note 6), we settled the contracts for a $ 1 loss. The loss was recorded to AOCI and will be amortized as an addition to interest expense over the life of the 4.75 % senior notes. The following table presents the pre-tax impact that changes in the fair value of our derivative instruments and non-derivative hedging instruments had on AOCI and earnings during each of the last three years:  Classification in Statement of Operations 2021 2022 2023 Currency derivatives designated as cash flow hedges: Net gain (loss) recognized in AOCI n/a $ ( 78 ) $ 76  $ 4  Net gain (loss) reclassified from AOCI into earnings Sales 21  5  37  Net gain (loss) reclassified from AOCI into earnings Other income (expense), net —  2  —  Interest rate derivatives designated as cash flow hedges: Net gain (loss) recognized in AOCI n/a —  —  ( 1 ) Currency derivatives not designated as hedging instruments: Net gain (loss) recognized in earnings Sales ( 13 ) 12  ( 1 ) Net gain (loss) recognized in earnings Other income (expense), net 17  5  16  Foreign currency-denominated debt designated as net investment hedge: Net gain (loss) recognized in AOCI n/a ( 73 ) 78  3  Total amounts presented in the accompanying consolidated statements of operations for line items affected by the net gains (losses) shown above: Sales 4,526  5,081  5,372  Other income (expense), net 15  ( 59 ) ( 119 ) We expect to reclassify $ 6 of deferred net gains on cash flow hedges recorded in AOCI as of April 30, 2023, to earnings during fiscal 2024. This reclassification would offset the anticipated earnings impact of the underlying hedged exposures. The actual amounts that we ultimately reclassify to earnings will depend on the exchange rates in effect when the underlying hedged transactions occur. The following table presents the fair values of our derivative instruments as of April 30, 2022 and 2023:  Balance Sheet Classification Derivative Assets Derivative Liabilities April 30, 2022 Designated as cash flow hedges: Currency derivatives Other current assets $ 32  $ ( 3 ) Currency derivatives Other assets 20  ( 1 ) Not designated as hedges: Currency derivatives Accrued expenses —  ( 1 ) April 30, 2023 Designated as cash flow hedges: Currency derivatives Other current assets 20  ( 11 ) Currency derivatives Other assets 5  ( 1 ) Currency derivatives Accrued expenses —  ( 1 ) Currency derivatives Other liabilities —  ( 1 ) Not designated as hedges: Currency derivatives Other current assets 3  —  The fair values reflected in the above table are presented on a gross basis. However, as discussed further below, the fair values of those instruments subject to net settlement agreements are presented on a net basis in our balance sheets. In our statements of cash flows, we classify cash flows related to cash flow hedges in the same category as the cash flows from the hedged items. Credit risk. We are exposed to credit-related losses if the counterparties to our derivative contracts default. This credit risk is limited to the fair value of the contracts. To manage this risk, we contract only with major financial institutions that have earned investment-grade credit ratings and with whom we have standard International Swaps and Derivatives Association (ISDA) agreements that allow for net settlement of the derivative contracts. Also, we have established counterparty credit guidelines that we monitor regularly. Based on our most recent assessment. we consider our counterparty credit risk to be low. Our derivative instruments require us to maintain a specific level of creditworthiness, which we have maintained. If our creditworthiness were to fall below that level, then the counterparties to our derivative instruments could request immediate payment or collateralization for derivative instruments in net liability positions. The aggregate fair value of all derivatives with creditworthiness requirements that were in a net liability position was $ 0 and $ 1 at April 30, 2022 and 2023, respectively. Offsetting. As noted above, our derivative contracts are governed by ISDA agreements that allow for net settlement of derivative contracts with the same counterparty. It is our policy to present the fair values of current derivatives (that is, those with a remaining term of 12 months or less) with the same counterparty on a net basis in our balance sheets. Similarly, we present the fair values of noncurrent derivatives with the same counterparty on a net basis. We do not net current derivatives with noncurrent derivatives in our balance sheets. The following table summarizes the gross and net amounts of our derivative contracts:  Gross Amounts of Recognized Assets (Liabilities) Gross Amounts Offset in Balance Sheet Net Amounts Presented in Balance Sheet Gross Amounts Not Offset in Balance Sheet Net Amounts April 30, 2022 Derivative assets $ 52  $ ( 4 ) $ 48  $ ( 1 ) $ 47  Derivative liabilities ( 5 ) 4  ( 1 ) 1  —  April 30, 2023 Derivative assets 28  ( 12 ) 16  ( 1 ) 15  Derivative liabilities ( 14 ) 12  ( 2 ) 1  ( 1 ) No cash collateral was received or pledged related to our derivative contracts as of April 30, 2022 or 2023. 14. F air Value Measurements The following table summarizes the assets and liabilities measured or disclosed at fair value on a recurring basis:   2022 2023 April 30, Carrying Amount Fair Value Carrying Amount Fair Value Assets: Cash and cash equivalents $ 868  $ 868  $ 374  $ 374  Currency derivatives 48  48  16  16  Liabilities: Currency derivatives 1  1  2  2  Contingent consideration (Note 12) —  —  56  56  Short-term borrowings —  —  235  235  Long-term debt (including current portion) 2,269  2,239  2,678  2,556  Fair value is defined as the exchange price that would be received for an asset or paid to transfer a liability in the principal or most advantageous market for the asset or liability in an orderly transaction between market participants at the measurement date. We categorize the fair values of assets and liabilities into three levels based on the assumptions (inputs) used to determine those values. Level 1 provides the most reliable measure of fair value, while Level 3 generally requires significant management judgment. The three levels are: • Level 1 – Quoted prices (unadjusted) in active markets for identical assets or liabilities. • Level 2 – Observable inputs other than those included in Level 1, such as quoted prices for similar assets and liabilities in active markets, quoted prices for identical or similar assets and liabilities in inactive markets, or other inputs that are observable or can be derived from or corroborated by observable market data. • Level 3 – Unobservable inputs supported by little or no market activity. We determine the fair values of our currency derivatives (forward contracts) using standard valuation models. The significant inputs used in these models, which are readily available in public markets or can be derived from observable market transactions, include the applicable spot exchange rates, forward exchange rates, and interest rates. These fair value measurements are categorized as Level 2 within the valuation hierarchy. We determine the fair value of long-term debt primarily based on the prices at which identical or similar debt has recently traded in the market and also considering the overall market conditions on the date of valuation. These fair value measurements are categorized as Level 2 within the valuation hierarchy. The fair values of cash, cash equivalents, and short-term borrowings approximate the carrying amounts due to the short maturities of these instruments. We measure some assets and liabilities at fair value on a nonrecurring basis. That is, we do not measure them at fair value on an ongoing basis, but we do adjust them to fair value in some circumstances (for example, when we determine that an asset is impaired). During fiscal 2022, we recognized non-cash impairment charges of $ 9 on certain fixed assets. The impairment charges, which were based on our measurements of the estimated fair values of those assets, are categorized as Level 2 within the valuation hierarchy. The remaining carrying amount of those fixed assets is not significant. As discussed in Note 4, we recognized non-cash impairment charges of $ 52 and $ 96 related to the Finlandia brand name during fiscal 2022 and 2023, respectively. The impairment charges were based on the estimated fair value of the brand name, which we determined using the relief-from-royalty method. As discussed in Note 12, we used the relief-from-royalty method and the Monte Carlo simulation model to determine fair values in connection with our accounting for business combinations. The fair value measurements determined using these models are categorized as Level 3 within the valuation hierarchy. No other material nonrecurring fair value measurements were required during the periods presented in these financial statements. 15. Leases We enter into lease arrangements, which we use primarily for office space, vehicles, and land. Substantially all of our leases are operating leases. Our finance leases are not material. We record lease liabilities and right-of-use (ROU) assets on our balance sheet for leases with terms exceeding 12 months. We do not record lease liabilities or ROU assets for short-term leases. The amounts recorded for lease liabilities and ROU assets are based on the estimated present value, as of the lease commencement date, of the future payments to be made over the lease term. We calculate the present value using our incremental borrowing rate that corresponds to the term of the lease. We include the effect of an option to renew or terminate a lease in the lease term when it is reasonably certain that we will exercise the option. Some of our leases contain non-lease components (e.g., maintenance or other services) in addition to lease components. We have elected the practical expedient not to separate the non-lease components from the lease components. The following table shows information about our leases as of the end of the last two years:  Balance Sheet Classification April 30, 2022 April 30, 2023 Right-of-use assets Other assets $ 74  $ 84  Lease liabilities: Current Accounts payable and accrued expenses $ 21  $ 22  Non-current Other liabilities 54  63  Total $ 75  $ 85  Weighted-average discount rate 1.8 % 3.3 % Weighted-average remaining term 5.0 years 5.1 years The following table shows information about the effects of leases during each of the last three years:  2021 2022 2023 Total lease cost 1 $ 41  $ 38  $ 38  Cash paid for amounts included in the measurement of lease liabilities 2 26  25  25  Right-of-use assets obtained in exchange for new lease liabilities 25  35  29  1 Consists primarily of operating lease cost. Other components of lease cost were not material. 2 Classified within operating activities in the accompanying consolidated statements of cash flows.

Otherwise, the pre-tax amount for each year is classified as sales. 2 For 2021, $ 4 of the pre-tax amount of $ 30 is classified in gain on sale of business in the accompanying consolidated statements of operations. Otherwise, the pre-tax amount for each year is classified as non-operating postretirement expense. 17. Supplemental Information The following table presents net sales by geography:   2021 2022 2023 Net sales: United States $ 1,748  $ 1,917  $ 1,968  Mexico 150  178  244  Germany 206  228  239  Australia 209  219  221  United Kingdom 205  218  207  Other 943  1,173  1,349  $ 3,461  $ 3,933  $ 4,228  Net sales are attributed to countries based on where customers are located. See Note 8 for additional information about net sales, including net sales by product category. Our two largest customers accounted for 19 % and 13 % of consolidated net sales in 2021; 14 % and 12 % of consolidated net sales in 2022; and 14 % and 12 % of consolidated net sales in 2023. The net book value of property, plant, and equipment located outside the United States was $ 116 and $ 204 as of April 30, 2022 and 2023, respectively. Other long-lived assets located outside the United States are not significant. We have concluded that our business constitutes a single operating segment. ']\n"

       "{'Risks Relating to Our Business and Industries ': '\\n\\nOur operations have been and may in the future be adversely impacted as a result of pandemic outbreaks, including COVID-19. \\n\\nThe COVID-19 pandemic has had, and continues to have, a significant impact around the world causing a disruption of global financial markets and increased levels of unemployment and economic uncertainty. Since early 2020, government officials around the world, including in the countries where we operate, have imposed measures in response to the pandemic, including vaccination and masking requirements, protocols related to workplace activities, travel and large gathering \\n\\nTabl e of Contents \\n\\nrestrictions, social distancing requirements, quarantines and shelter-in-place and stay-at-home orders. Certain of these restrictions remain in place today. The COVID-19 pandemic has curtailed global economic activity and caused significant volatility and disruption in global financial markets. During the course of the pandemic, we have not seen a significant disruption in our supply chain and we have been able to mitigate logistics and distribution issues that have arisen, and substantially all of our facilities around the world have continued to operate at or near normal levels. We have, however, experienced minor temporary workforce disruptions in our supply chain as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic, including increased labor shortages and increased turnover. We have established an internal task force to closely monitor developments related to the pandemic and have implemented employee safety measures based on guidance from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, the World Health Organization, and local requirements and guidelines, across all our facilities, including proper hygiene, social distancing, mask use, and temperature screenings. We continue to closely monitor developments related to the pandemic to ensure the health and safety of our employees. While all facilities are currently operating normally, our internal task force is prepared to re-establish safety measures and protocols should infection rates increase. We continue to monitor local, regional, and national governmental actions that could limit or restrict the movement of agricultural commodities or products or otherwise disrupt physical product flows or our ability to operate in the future. \\n\\nAny future impacts of COVID-19 or any new pandemic may adversely affect our operations, major facilities, or employees&#8217; and consumers&#8217; health and negatively impact general commercial activity related to our supply chain and customer base. The extent to which we will be impacted by COVID-19 or any new pandemic is difficult to predict and cannot be estimated with any degree of certainty and will depend on many factors outside of our control. These factors include the timing, extent, trajectory and duration of any pandemic, the emergence of new COVID-19 variants, the development, availability, distribution and effectiveness of vaccines and treatments, the imposition of protective public safety measures, and the impact of the pandemic on the global economy. To the extent the COVID-19 pandemic or any new pandemic adversely affects our business, results of operations, financial condition and share price, it may also have the effect of heightening many of the other risks described in this Item 1A. \\n\\nAdverse weather conditions, including as a result of climate change, may adversely affect the availability, quality and price of agricultural commodities and agricultural commodity products, as well as our operations, supply chains, and operating results. \\n\\nAdverse weather conditions have historically caused volatility in the agricultural commodity industry and consequently in our operating results by causing crop failures or significantly reduced harvests, which may affect the supply and pricing of the agricultural commodities that we sell and use in our business, reduce demand for our fertilizer products, and negatively affect the creditworthiness of agricultural producers who do business with us. \\n\\nSevere adverse weather conditions, such as hurricanes and severe storms, may also result in extensive property damage, extended business interruption, personal injuries, and other loss and damage to us. Our operations also rely on dependable and efficient transportation services, including transportation by ocean vessel, river barges, rail, and truck. A disruption in transportation services as a result of weather conditions, such as low river levels following periods of drought, may also have a significant adverse impact on our operations and related supply chains. \\n\\nAdditionally, the potential physical impacts of climate change are uncertain and may vary by region. These potential effects could include changes in rainfall patterns, water shortages, changing sea levels, changing storm patterns and intensities, shifts in agricultural production areas, changing temperature levels, and climatic volatility. The frequency and severity of the effects of climate change or weather patterns could increase and adversely impact our business operations, the location, costs and competitiveness of global agricultural commodity production and related storage and processing facilities, as well as the supply and demand for agricultural commodities, and may result in incidents of stranded physical assets. These effects could be material to our results of operations, liquidity or capital resources. \\n\\nThe ongoing war between Russia and Ukraine may adversely affect our business, financial condition or results of operations. \\n\\nWe maintain operations in Ukraine and Russia. Ukraine forms part of a key international grain originating region and is also the world&#8217;s largest supplier of sunflower seed and sunflower oil, commodities that cannot be completely replaced from other origins. On February 24, 2022, Russia initiated a military offensive in Ukraine. Bunge&#8217;s Ukrainian operations comprise two oilseed crushing facilities, located in Mykolaiv and Dnipropetrovsk, a grain export terminal in the Mykolaiv commercial seaport, numerous grain elevators, and an office in Kiev. The Company also operates a corn milling facility in Ukraine via a joint venture. Assets and operations located in regions affected by the war are at a heightened risk of property damage, inventory loss, business disruption, and expropriation. As of the date of this Annual Report, no material damage has been noted at any of Bunge&#8217;s Ukrainian facilities; however, due to safety concerns, it is not always possible to conduct onsite physical inspections of our Ukrainian facilities to understand the full extent of the impact of the war. As of December 31, 2022, we had total assets and total liabilities of $262 million and $125 million, respectively, in Ukraine. \\n\\nTabl e of Contents \\n\\nOur Ukrainian operations employ approximately 1,000 employees. While as of the date of this Annual Report some of our Ukrainian employees have been forced to relocate to other areas within Ukraine or to other countries, our workforce remains largely intact. The ongoing war could cause harm to our employees and otherwise impair their ability to work for extended periods of time, which could have a material adverse effect on our operations. Disruption to the power grid, transportation routes, telecommunications systems, banks, and other critical infrastructure necessary to conduct business in Ukraine could also severely impair our Ukrainian operations. The scope, intensity, duration and outcome of the ongoing war is uncertain, and the continuation or escalation of the war may have a material adverse effect on Bunge&#8217;s assets, operations and financial condition. \\n\\nAdditionally, in response to the war, the United States, other NATO member states, as well as non-NATO member states, have announced targeted economic sanctions on Russia, certain Russian citizens, and Russian enterprises. Any continuation or escalation of the war may trigger a series of additional economic and other sanctions. On September 16, 2022, Bunge signed an agreement to sell its remaining Russian operations, primarily comprising an oilseed crushing and refining facility in Voronezh, southwest Russia, to Karen Vanetsyan. On February 3, 2023, the transaction closed in accordance with the terms of the agreement. We continued to operate our Russian oilseed crushing and refining facility in compliance with all legal requirements until the sale was completed. \\n\\nIn addition, the risk of cybersecurity incidents has increased in connection with the ongoing war, driven by justifications such as retaliation for the sanctions imposed in conjunction with the war, or in response to certain companies\\' continued operations in Russia. See \"&#8212; Our information technology systems, processes and sites may suffer interruptions, security breaches or failures that may adversely affect our ability to conduct our business. \" \\n\\nAlthough we insure ourselves against many types of risks, including certain risks associated with the ongoing war, our level of insurance may not cover all losses we could incur. There could be a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition if we are not able to adequately insure against the possible exposure we could experience as a result of the war. To the extent the current war adversely affects our business, it may also have the effect of heightening many other risks disclosed in this Item 1A, any of which could materially and adversely affect our business and results of operations. Due to the continuously evolving nature of the war, the potential impact that the war could have on these risk factors, and others that cannot yet be identified, remains uncertain. Even if the war moderates, or a resolution between Ukraine and Russia is reached, we expect that we will continue to experience ongoing financial and operational impacts resulting from the war for the foreseeable future as Ukraine rebuilds its economy and infrastructure. \\n\\nWe are subject to fluctuations in agricultural commodity and other raw material prices, energy prices, and other factors outside of our control that could adversely affect our operating results. \\n\\nPrices for agricultural commodities and their by-products, including, among others, soybeans, corn, wheat, sugar and ethanol, like those of other commodities, are often volatile and sensitive to local and international changes in supply and demand caused by factors outside of our control, including farmer planting and selling decisions, currency fluctuations, inflation, government agriculture programs and policies, pandemics (such as the COVID-19 pandemic), governmental restrictions or mandates, global inventory levels, demand for biofuels, weather and crop conditions, and demand for and supply of competing commodities and substitutes. These factors may cause volatility in our operating results. \\n\\nIn 2022, certain of our raw material input costs increased materially and at a rapid rate. We expect the pressures of input cost inflation to continue into 2023. We may not be able to generate sufficient productivity improvements, price increases or commodity hedging benefits to fully offset these costs or do so on an acceptable timeline. To the extent we are unable to offset present and future input cost increases, our operating results could be materially and adversely affected. \\n\\nAdditionally, our operating costs and the selling prices of certain of our products are sensitive to changes in energy prices. Our industrial operations utilize significant amounts of electricity, natural gas and coal, and our transportation operations are dependent upon diesel fuel and other petroleum-based products. Significant increases in the cost of these items, including as a result of the Ukraine-Russia war, and currency fluctuations could adversely affect our operating costs and results. We also sell certain biofuel products, such as ethanol, renewable diesel, and biodiesel, which are closely related to, or may be substituted for, petroleum products. As a result, the selling prices of ethanol, renewable diesel, and biodiesel can be impacted by the selling prices of oil, gasoline and diesel fuel. In turn, the selling prices of the agricultural commodities and commodity products that we sell, such as corn and vegetable oils that are used as feedstocks for biofuels, are also sensitive to changes in the market price for biofuels, and consequently world petroleum prices. Prices for petroleum products and biofuels are affected by market and geopolitical factors and government fuel policies, over which we have no control. Lower prices for oil, gasoline or diesel fuel could result in decreased selling prices for ethanol, renewable diesel, biodiesel and their raw materials, which could adversely affect our revenues and operating results. \\n\\nOur business is seasonal, and our results may fluctuate depending on the harvest cycle of the crops upon which we rely and seasonal fluctuations related to the sale of our consumer products. \\n\\nTabl e of Contents \\n\\nAs with any agricultural business enterprise, our business operations are seasonal in nature. For example, in our Agribusiness segment, while there is a degree of seasonality in the growing season and procurement of our principal raw materials, such as oilseeds and grains, we typically do not experience material fluctuations in volume between the first and second half of the year since we are geographically diversified between the northern and southern hemispheres. However, the first quarter of the year has generally been our weakest in terms of financial results due to the timing of the North and South American oilseed harvests, as the North American oilseed harvest peaks in the third and fourth quarters, while the South American harvest peaks in the second quarter. This creates price fluctuations, which result in fluctuations in our inventories and a degree of seasonality in our gross profit. In addition, certain of our consumer food products are influenced by holidays and other annual events. Seasonality could have a material adverse effect on our business and financial performance. In addition, our quarterly results may vary as a result of the effects of fluctuations in commodities prices, production yields and costs. \\n\\nWe face intense competition in each of our businesses. \\n\\nWe face significant competition in each of our businesses and we have numerous competitors, some of which are larger, more diversified and have greater financial resources than we have. Additionally, in recent years we have experienced regional Agribusiness competitors entering new geographies where previously they did not compete with us, and certain customers seeking to procure certain commodities directly rather than through historical suppliers such as us. Furthermore, in conjunction with the recent increase in demand for renewable biodiesel feedstocks, we have experienced added competition for refining capacity from traditional petroleum companies. As many of the products we sell are global commodities, the markets for our products are highly price competitive, and in many cases also sensitive to product substitution. Additionally, the geographic location of assets can competitively advantage or disadvantage us with respect to our competitors in certain regions. We also face competition from changing technologies and shifting industry practices, such as increased on-farm crop storage in several regions, which allows producers to retain commodities for extended periods and increase price pressure on purchasers such as us. To compete effectively, we must continuously focus on improving efficiency in our production and distribution operations, including through business optimization initiatives, developing and offering products that meet customer needs, optimizing our geographic presence in key markets, developing and maintaining appropriate market share and customer relationships, supporting socially responsible and sustainable corporate and business practices, and promoting our environmental stewardship. We also compete for talent in our industries, particularly commercial personnel. Competition could cause us to lose market share and talented employees, exit certain lines of business, increase marketing or other expenditures, increase our raw material costs or reduce pricing, each of which could have an adverse effect on our business and profitability. \\n\\nWe are vulnerable to the effects of supply and demand imbalances in our industries . \\n\\nHistorically, the market for some agricultural commodities and fertilizer products has been cyclical, with periods of high demand and capacity utilization stimulating new plant investment and the addition of incremental processing or production capacity by industry participants to meet the demand. The timing and extent of this expansion may then produce excess supply conditions in the market, which, until the supply/demand balance is again restored, negatively impacts product prices and operating results. During times of reduced market demand, we may suspend or reduce production at some of our facilities. The extent to which we efficiently manage available capacity at our facilities will affect our profitability, including the profitability of our Bunge Chevron Ag Renewables joint venture (\"Bunge Chevron JV\"). We also expect the results from our equity investment in the BP Bunge Bioenergia joint venture to be impacted by any potential shortage of, or increasing costs for, sugarcane. \\n\\nWe are subject to global and regional economic downturns and related risks. \\n\\nThe level of demand for our products is affected by global and regional demographic and macroeconomic conditions, including population growth rates and changes in standards of living. A significant downturn in global economic growth, or recessionary conditions in major geographic regions, may lead to reduced demand for agricultural commodities and food products, which could adversely affect our business and results of operations. Further, deteriorating economic and political conditions in our major markets, such as inflation, increased unemployment, decreases in disposable income, declines in consumer confidence, uncertainty about economic stability, or economic slowdowns or recessions, could cause a decrease in demand for our products. \\n\\nAdditionally, weak global economic conditions and adverse conditions in global financial and capital markets, including rising interest rates and constraints on the availability of credit, have in the past adversely affected, and may in the future adversely affect, the financial condition and creditworthiness of some of our customers, suppliers and other counterparties, which in turn may negatively impact our financial condition and results of operations. See \"Item 7. Management\\'s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations\" and \"Item 7A. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk\" for more information. \\n\\nIn 2022, the United States reported high inflation rates and weaker GDP growth, with some economists forecasting a continuation of these conditions in 2023. Brazil has experienced a slowing GDP growth rate coupled with relatively high \\n\\nTabl e of Contents \\n\\ninterest rates as it emerges from the COVID-19 pandemic, which may result in an uncertain economic and political environment that could in turn lead to reduced demand for our refined and specialty oils and milling products in the country. Additionally, a slowdown in China\\'s economy over a prolonged period, including as a result of continuing impacts of COVID-19, population decline and other factors, could lead to reduced global demand for agricultural commodities. To the extent that such economic and political conditions negatively impact consumer and business confidence and consumption patterns or volumes, our business and results of operations could be significantly and adversely affected. \\n\\nWe are subject to economic, political, and other risks of doing business globally and in emerging markets. \\n\\nWe are a global business with a substantial majority of our assets and operations located outside the United States. In addition, our business strategies may involve expanding or developing our business in emerging market regions, including Eastern Europe, Asia-Pacific, the Middle East, and Africa. Due to the international nature of our business, we are exposed to various risks of international operations, including: \\n\\n&#8226; adverse trade policies or trade barriers on agricultural commodities and commodity products; \\n\\n&#8226; government regulations and mandates in response to the COVID-19 pandemic; \\n\\n&#8226; new and developing requirements related to GHG emissions and other climate change initiatives and workforce diversity and inclusion mandates; \\n\\n&#8226; inflation, hyperinflation, and adverse economic effects resulting from governmental attempts to control inflation, such as the imposition of wage and price controls and higher interest rates. For example, inflation rates in many countries in which we operate are currently at the highest levels in decades, resulting in tighter monetary policies, including higher interest rates. In addition, Turkey, a country in which we operate, has experienced negative economic trends and multiple periods of high inflation rates. During the first quarter of 2022, Turkey became a highly inflationary economy as defined under U.S. Generally Accepted Accounting Principles (\"U.S. GAAP\"). \\n\\n&#8226; changes in laws and regulations or their interpretation or enforcement in the countries in which we operate, including the risk of future adverse tax regulations relating to our status as a Bermuda company in the event that the Redomestication is delayed or otherwise abandoned, and the effects of complying with Swiss tax law on us and our shareholders after the completion of the Redomestication; \\n\\n&#8226; difficulties in enforcing agreements or judgments and collecting receivables in foreign jurisdictions; \\n\\n&#8226; exchange controls or other currency restrictions and limitations on the movement of funds, such as on the remittance of dividends by subsidiaries, most notably in Ukraine and Argentina; \\n\\n&#8226; inadequate infrastructure and logistics challenges; \\n\\n&#8226; sovereign risk and the risk of government intervention, including through expropriation, or regulation of the economy or natural resources, including restrictions on foreign ownership of land or other assets; \\n\\n&#8226; the requirement to comply with a wide variety of laws and regulations that apply to international operations, including, without limitation, economic sanctions regulations, labor laws, import and export regulations, anti-corruption and anti-bribery laws, as well as other laws or regulations discussed in this \"Item 1A. Risk Factors \" section; \\n\\n&#8226; challenges in maintaining an effective internal control environment with operations in multiple international locations, including language differences, varying levels of U.S. GAAP expertise in international locations and multiple financial information systems; \\n\\n&#8226; changes in a country&#8217;s or region&#8217;s economic or political condition; and \\n\\n&#8226; labor disruptions, civil unrest, significant political instability, coup attempts, wars or other armed conflict or acts of terrorism. See \" &#8212;The ongoing war between Russia and Ukraine may adversely affect our business, financial condition or results of operations.\" \\n\\nThese risks could adversely affect our operations, business strategies, and operating results. \\n\\nAs a result of our international operations, we are also exposed to currency exchange rate fluctuations. Changes in exchange rates between the U.S. dollar and other foreign currencies, particularly the Brazilian real , Canadian dollar , the euro , and Chinese yuan/renminbi affect our revenues and expenses that are denominated in local currencies, affect farm economics in those regions and may also have a negative impact on the value of our assets located outside of the United States. \\n\\nAdditionally, there continues to be a great deal of uncertainty regarding U.S. and global trade policies for companies with multinational operations like ours. In recent years, there has been an increase in populism and nationalism in various countries around the world and consequently historical free trade principles are being challenged. As we continue to operate our business globally, our success will depend, in part, on the nature and extent of any such changes and how well we are able to anticipate, respond to and effectively manage any such changes. \\n\\nTabl e of Contents \\n\\nGovernment policies and regulations affecting the agricultural sector and related industries could adversely affect our operations and profitability. \\n\\nAgricultural commodity production and trade flows are significantly affected by government policies and regulations. Governmental policies affecting the agricultural industry, such as taxes (including \"windfall profits\" taxes), tariffs, duties, subsidies, import and export restrictions, price controls on agricultural commodities, and energy policies (including biofuels mandates), can influence industry profitability, the planting of certain crops versus other uses of agricultural resources, the location and size of crop production, whether unprocessed or processed commodity products are traded, and the volume and types of imports and exports. Additionally, regulation of financial markets and instruments in the United States and internationally may create uncertainty as these laws are adopted and implemented and may impose significant additional risks and costs that could impact our risk management practices. Further, increases in food and fertilizer prices have in the past resulted in increased scrutiny of our industries under antitrust and competition laws in various jurisdictions and increase the risk that these laws could be interpreted, administered or enforced in a manner that could affect our operations or impose liabilities on us that could have a material adverse effect on our operating results and financial condition. Future governmental policies, regulations or actions impacting our industries may adversely affect the supply of, demand for, and prices of our products, restrict our ability to do business in existing and target markets, or engage in risk management activities and otherwise cause our financial results to suffer. \\n\\nFinally, international trade disputes can adversely affect agricultural commodity trade flows by limiting or disrupting trade between countries or regions, particularly disputes involving the United States and China. This has in the past led, and can in the future lead, to significant volatility in commodity prices, disruptions in historical trade flows and shifts in planting patterns in the United States and South America, which have presented challenges and uncertainties for our business. We cannot predict the impacts that future trade policy or the terms of any negotiated trade agreements could have on our business and operations. \\n\\nWe may not realize the anticipated benefits of acquisitions, divestitures or joint ventures. \\n\\nWe have been an active acquirer of other companies, and we have joint ventures with several partners. Part of our strategy involves acquisitions, alliances and joint ventures designed to expand or optimize our portfolio of businesses. Our ability to benefit from acquisitions, joint ventures, and alliances depends on many factors, including our ability to identify suitable prospects, access funding sources on acceptable terms, negotiate favorable transaction terms, and successfully consummate and integrate any businesses we acquire. In addition, we proactively review our portfolio of businesses in order to identify opportunities to enhance shareholder value and may decide as a result of such reviews or otherwise, from time to time, to divest certain of our assets or businesses by selling them or entering into joint ventures. Our ability to successfully complete a divestiture will depend on, among other things, our ability to identify buyers that are prepared to acquire such assets or businesses on acceptable terms and to adjust and optimize our retained businesses following the divestiture. \\n\\nOur acquisition, joint venture, or divestiture activities may involve unanticipated delays, costs, and other problems. If we encounter unexpected problems with acquisitions, joint ventures, or divestitures, our senior management may be required to divert attention away from other aspects of our businesses to address these problems. Additionally, we may fail to consummate proposed acquisitions, joint ventures or divestitures, after incurring expenses and devoting substantial resources, including management time, to such transactions. \\n\\nAcquisitions also pose the risk that we may be exposed to successor liability relating to actions by an acquired company and its management before the acquisition. The due diligence we conduct in connection with an acquisition, the controls and policies we implement at acquired companies, and any contractual guarantees or indemnities that we receive from the sellers of acquired companies, may not be sufficient to protect us from, or compensate us for, actual liabilities. A material liability associated with an acquisition could adversely affect our reputation and results of operations and reduce the benefits of the acquisition. Additionally, acquisitions involve other risks, such as differing levels of management and internal control effectiveness at the acquired entities, systems integration risks, the risk of impairment charges relating to goodwill and intangible assets recorded in connection with acquisitions, the risk of significant accounting charges and expenses resulting from the completion and integration of a sizable acquisition, the need to fund increased capital expenditures and working capital requirements, our ability to retain and motivate employees of acquired entities, compliance and reputational risks and other unanticipated problems and liabilities. \\n\\nDivestitures may also expose us to potential liabilities or claims for indemnification, as we may be required to retain certain liabilities or indemnify buyers for certain matters, including environmental or litigation matters associated with the assets or businesses that we sell. The magnitude of any such retained liability or indemnification obligation may be difficult to quantify at the time of the transaction and its cost to us could ultimately exceed the proceeds we receive for the divested assets or businesses. Divestitures also have other inherent risks, including possible delays in closing transactions (including potential difficulties in obtaining regulatory approvals), the risk of lower-than-expected sales proceeds for the divested businesses and unexpected costs or other difficulties associated with the separation of the businesses to be sold from our \\n\\nTabl e of Contents \\n\\ninformation technology systems and other management processes, including the loss of key personnel. Further, expected cost savings or other anticipated efficiencies or benefits from divestitures may also be difficult to achieve or maximize. \\n\\nAdditionally, we have several joint ventures and investments in which we have limited control over governance, financial reporting, and operations. As a result, we face certain operating, financial, and other risks relating to these investments, including risks related to the financial strength of our joint venture partners or their willingness to provide adequate funding for the joint venture, having differing objectives from our partners, the inability to implement some actions with respect to the joint venture\\'s activities that we may believe are favorable if the joint venture partner does not agree, compliance risks relating to actions of the joint venture or our partners, and the risk that we will be unable to resolve disputes with the joint venture partner. As a result, these investments may contribute significantly less than anticipated to our earnings and cash flows. \\n\\nWe have a 50% ownership interest in BP Bunge Bioenergia joint venture related to our sugar and ethanol business in Brazil. We share control in BP Bunge Bioenergia with BP, our joint venture partner, and as a result, our ability to realize the benefits of this joint venture will depend in part on our ability to work with and cooperate with BP, as well as the talent of the leadership of BP Bunge Bioenergia. In addition, the business and financial performance of the BP Bunge Bioenergia joint venture may be adversely affected if there is a significant shortage of sugarcane supply, which is the principal raw material used in the production of ethanol and sugar, or if there is an increase in the cost of available sugarcane, which could result from any termination of the joint venture&#8217;s partnership or supply contracts. \\n\\nIn May 2022, we entered into the Bunge Chevron JV, in which we have a 50% ownership interest through the contribution of two soybean processing facilities. Under the terms of the joint venture, we have agreed to operate the joint venture&#8217;s facilities, and Chevron Corporation (\"Chevron\") will have purchase rights for oil produced by the joint venture for use as a renewable feedstock to manufacture low lifecycle carbon intensity transportation fuels. We share control of certain key decisions pertaining to the Bunge Chevron JV with Chevron, our joint venture partner, and as a result, our ability to realize the benefits of this joint venture will depend in part on our ability to work with and cooperate with Chevron. The business and financial performance of the Bunge Chevron JV may also be adversely affected if there is a significant decrease in demand for renewable diesel. Additionally, the Bunge Chevron JV is subject to risks similar to our other soybean processing facilities, which are described in this Item 1A. \\n\\nWe are subject to industry and other risks that could adversely affect our reputation and financial results. \\n\\nWe are subject to food and feed industry risks which include, but are not limited to, spoilage, contamination, tampering or other adulteration of products, product liability claims, and recalls. We are also subject to shifts in customer and consumer preferences, including as a result of COVID-19, and concerns regarding the outbreak of disease associated with livestock and poultry, including avian or swine influenza. Also, increasing focus on climate change, deforestation, water, animal welfare and human rights concerns, and other risks associated with the global food system may lead to increased activism focusing on food companies and their suppliers, governmental intervention and consumer responses. These risks could adversely affect our, or our suppliers&#8217;, reputations and businesses and our ability to procure the materials we need to operate our business. \\n\\nAs a company whose products comprise staple food and feed products sold globally, as well as ingredients included in trusted food brands of our customers, maintaining a good corporate reputation is critical to our continued success. Reputational value is based in large part on perceptions, which can shift rapidly in response to negative incidents. The failure or alleged failure to maintain high standards for quality, safety, integrity, environmental sustainability and social responsibility, including with respect to raw materials and services obtained from suppliers, even if untrue, may result in tangible effects, such as reduced demand for our products, disruptions to our operations, increased costs and a loss of market share to competitors. Our reputation and results of operations could also be adversely impacted by changing consumer preferences and perceptions relating to some of the products we sell, such as with regard to the quantity and type of fats, sugars, and grains consumed, as well as concerns regarding genetically modified crops. Failure to anticipate, adapt or respond effectively to these trends or issues may result in material adverse effects on our business, financial condition, and results of operations. \\n\\nWe are subject to numerous laws and regulations globally, which could adversely affect our operating results. \\n\\nDue to our global business operations, we are required to comply with numerous laws and regulations in the countries in which we operate. These include general business regulations, such as with respect to taxes, accounting, anti-corruption and fair competition, trade sanctions, product safety, and environmental matters, as well as those governing the manufacturing, production, handling, storage, transport, marketing and sale of our products. These include laws and regulations relating to facility licensing and permitting, food and feed safety, the handling and production of regulated substances, nutritional and labeling requirements, global trade compliance and other matters. Our operations and those of our suppliers are also subject to restrictions on land use in certain protected areas, forestry reserve requirements, and limitations on water use. In addition to liabilities arising out of our current and future operations for which we have ongoing processes to manage compliance with regulatory obligations, we may be subject to environmental liabilities for past operations at current facilities and in some cases \\n\\nTabl e of Contents \\n\\nto liabilities for past operations at facilities that we no longer own or operate. We may also be subject to liabilities for operations of acquired companies. Our industrial activities can also result in serious accidents that could result in personal injuries, facility shutdowns, reputational harm to our business and/or the expenditure of significant amounts to remediate safety issues or repair damaged facilities. We may incur material costs or liabilities to comply with environmental, health and safety requirements. Any failure to comply with applicable laws and regulations may subject us to substantial fines, administrative sanctions, criminal penalties, revocations of operating permits and/or shutdowns of our facilities, litigation, and other liabilities, as well as damage to our reputation. \\n\\nDue to the international scope of our operations, we are subject to a complex system of import- and export-related laws and regulations, including U.S. regulations issued by Customs and Border Protection, the Bureau of Industry and Security, the Office of Antiboycott Compliance, the Directorate of Defense Trade Controls and Office of Foreign Assets Control, as well as the counterparts of these agencies in other countries. Any alleged or actual violations may subject us to government scrutiny, investigation and civil and criminal penalties, and may limit our ability to import or export our products, or to provide services outside the United States. Furthermore, embargoes and sanctions imposed by the United States and other governments restricting or prohibiting sales to specific persons or countries or based on product classification may expose us to potential criminal or civil sanctions. We cannot predict the nature, scope or effect of future regulatory requirements to which our operations might be subject or in certain locations the manner in which existing laws might be administered or interpreted. \\n\\nIn addition, continued government and public emphasis in countries in which we operate on environmental issues, including climate change, conservation and natural resource management, have resulted in and could result in new or more stringent forms of regulatory oversight or other limitations on the agricultural industry, including increased environmental controls, land-use restrictions affecting us or our suppliers and other conditions that could have a material adverse effect on our business, reputation, financial condition and results of operations. For example, certain aspects of our business and the larger food production chain generate carbon emissions. A number of jurisdictions in which we operate have implemented or are in the process of implementing carbon pricing programs or regulations to reduce GHG emissions, including, but not limited to, the United States, Canada, Mexico, the European Union and its member states, and China. For example, the Biden Administration has issued a series of executive orders and regulatory initiatives focused on climate change, including rejoining the Paris Climate Agreement, pursuant to which the Administration has announced a goal of halving U.S. GHG emissions by 2030. The imposition of regulatory restrictions on GHG emissions in many markets in which we operate, which may include limitations on GHG emissions, national emission reduction plans, requirements to make additional investments to modify our facilities, equipment and processes, other restrictions on industrial operations, taxes or fees on GHG emissions, and other measures, could affect land-use decisions, the cost of agricultural production and the cost and means of processing and transporting our products, which could adversely affect our business, cash flows, and results of operations. \\n\\nWe are exposed to credit and counterparty risk relating to our customer and supplier counterparties in the ordinary course of business. In particular, we advance capital and provide other financing arrangements to farmers in Brazil and, as a result, our business and financial results may be adversely affected if these farmers are unable to repay the capital advanced to them. \\n\\nWe have various credit terms with customers, and our customers have varying degrees of creditworthiness, which exposes us to the risk of non-payment or other default under our contracts and other arrangements with them. In the event that we experience significant defaults on their payment obligations to us, our financial condition, results of operations, or cash flows could be materially and adversely affected. \\n\\nIn Brazil, where there have been limited third-party financing sources available to farmers, we provide financing to farmers from whom we purchase soybeans and other agricultural commodities through prepaid commodity purchase contracts and advances, which are generally intended to be short-term in nature and are typically secured by the farmer\\'s crop and a mortgage on the farmer\\'s land and other assets to provide a means of repayment in the potential event of crop failure or shortfall. As of December 31, 2022 and 2021, respectively, we had approximately $651 million and $594 million in outstanding prepaid commodity purchase contracts, and advances to farmers. We are exposed to the risk that the underlying crop will be insufficient to satisfy a farmer\\'s obligation under the financing arrangements as a result of weather and crop growing conditions, and other factors that influence the price, supply and demand for agricultural commodities. In addition, any collateral held by us as part of these financing transactions may not be sufficient to fully protect us from loss. \\n\\nWe are a capital intensive business and depend on cash provided by our operations as well as access to external financing to operate and grow our business. \\n\\nWe require significant amounts of capital to operate our business and fund capital expenditures. Our working capital needs are directly affected by the prices of agricultural commodities, with increases in commodity prices generally causing increases in our borrowing levels. We are also required to make substantial capital expenditures to maintain, upgrade, and expand our extensive network of storage facilities, processing plants, refineries, mills, logistics assets, and other facilities to keep pace with competitive developments, technological advances and safety and environmental standards. Furthermore, the \\n\\nTabl e of Contents \\n\\nexpansion of our business and pursuit of acquisitions or other business opportunities may require us to have access to significant amounts of capital. If we are unable to generate sufficient cash flows or raise sufficient external financing on attractive terms to fund these activities, including as a result of a tightening in the global credit markets, we may be forced to limit our operations and growth plans, which may adversely impact our competitiveness and, therefore, our results of operations. \\n\\nAt December 31, 2022, Bunge had $6,665 million unused and available committed borrowing capacity comprising committed revolving credit facilities and the commercial paper program, totaling $5,665 million with a number of financial institutions, in addition to $1,000 million in committed unsecured delayed draw term loans. At December 31, 2022, our total debt balance is $4,651 million. Our debt levels could limit our ability to obtain additional financing, limit our flexibility in planning for, or reacting to, changes in the markets in which we compete, place us at a competitive disadvantage compared to our competitors that are less leveraged than we are, and require us to dedicate more cash on a relative basis to servicing our debt and less to developing our business. This may limit our ability to run our business and use our resources in the manner in which we would like. Furthermore, difficult conditions in global credit or financial markets, including increases in interest rates and diminished liquidity and credit availability, generally could increase the cost to finance our operations, adversely impact our ability to refinance maturing debt or the cost or other terms of such refinancing, or adversely affect the financial position of the lenders with whom we do business, which may reduce our ability to obtain financing for our operations. See \"Item 7. Management\\'s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations-Liquidity and Capital Resources. \" \\n\\nAccess to credit markets and pricing of company debt is also dependent on maintaining appropriate credit ratings, and one of our financial objectives has been to maintain an investment grade credit rating. While our debt agreements do not have any credit rating downgrade triggers that would accelerate the maturity of our debt, reductions in our credit ratings would increase our borrowing costs and, depending on their severity, could impede our ability to obtain credit facilities or access the capital markets in the future on favorable terms, as well as impair our ability to compete effectively relative to competitors with higher credit ratings. \\n\\nOur risk management strategies may not be effective. \\n\\nOur business is affected by fluctuations in agricultural commodity prices, transportation costs, energy prices, interest rates, and foreign currency exchange rates. We engage in hedging transactions to manage these risks. However, our exposures may not always be fully hedged, and our hedging strategies may not be successful in minimizing our exposure to these fluctuations. In addition, our risk management strategies may seek to position our overall portfolio relative to expected market movements. While we have implemented a broad range of risk monitoring and control procedures and policies to mitigate potential losses, they may not in all cases be successful in anticipating a significant risk exposure and protecting us from losses that have the potential to impair our financial position. See \"Item 7A. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk \". \\n\\nThe loss of, or a disruption in, our manufacturing and distribution operations or other operations and systems could adversely affect our business. \\n\\nWe are engaged in manufacturing and distribution activities on a global scale, and our business depends on our ability to execute and monitor, on a daily basis, a significant number of transactions across numerous markets or geographies. As a result, we are subject to the risks inherent in such activities, including industrial accidents, environmental events, fires, explosions, strikes and other labor or industrial disputes, disruptions in logistics or information systems, as well as natural disasters, pandemics (including the COVID-19 pandemic), wars (including the Ukraine-Russia war), acts of terrorism, and other external factors over which we have no control. While we insure ourselves against many of these types of risks in accordance with industry standards, our level of insurance may not cover all losses. The potential effects of these conditions could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations, and financial condition. \\n\\nOur information technology systems, processes and sites may suffer interruptions, security breaches or failures that may adversely affect our ability to conduct our business. \\n\\nWe rely on certain key information technology systems, some of which are dependent on services provided by third parties, to provide critical data and services for internal and external users, including procurement and inventory management, transaction processing, financial, commercial and operational data, human resources management, legal and tax compliance, and other information and processes necessary to operate and manage our business. If we or our third-party service providers do not respond or perform effectively in connection with a cyber breach or system failure, our business may be impacted. \\n\\nIncreased social engineering threats and more sophisticated computer crime, including advanced persistent threats and zero-day vulnerability exploits, pose a potential risk to the security of our information technology systems, networks and services, and we may incur significant costs in protecting against potential security breaches, cyber-based attacks, or other cyber incidents. We and our third-party service providers are targeted by malicious actors and expect such incidents to continue. While we have implemented cybersecurity and data protection measures, our efforts to minimize the risks of cyberattacks and protect our information technology systems may be insufficient and we may experience breaches or other failures or disruptions \\n\\nTabl e of Contents \\n\\nthat could compromise our systems and the information stored there as a result. Such risks increase while some of our workforce in certain countries in which we operate continues to work remotely. New technology that could result in greater operational efficiency may further expose our computer systems to the risk of cyberattacks. \\n\\nIn addition, the risk of cybersecurity incidents, including cyberattacks against the Ukrainian government and other countries in the region, has increased in connection with the ongoing Ukraine-Russia war, driven by justifications such as retaliation for the sanctions imposed in conjunction with the war, or in response to certain companies&#8217; continued operations in Russia. It is possible that these attacks could have collateral effects on additional critical infrastructure and financial institutions globally, which could adversely affect our operations and could increase the frequency and severity of cyber-based attacks against our information technology systems. While we have taken actions to mitigate such potential risks, the proliferation of malware from the war into systems unrelated to the war, or cyberattacks against U.S. companies in retaliation for U.S. sanctions against Russia, or U.S. support of Ukraine, could also adversely affect our operations. \\n\\nWe have implemented security policies, training programs, measures and disaster recovery plans designed to prevent, detect and mitigate cyber-based attacks, and to protect the security and continuity of our networks and critical systems. We use encryption and authentication technologies designed to secure the transmission and storage of data and prevent access to Company and user data or accounts. In addition, we also conduct tests and assessments using independent third parties on a regular basis. These measures may not adequately prevent adverse events such as breaches or failures from occurring, or mitigate their severity if they do occur. \\n\\nIf our information technology systems are breached, damaged or fail to function properly due to any number of causes, such as security breaches or cyber-based attacks, systems implementation difficulties, catastrophic events or power outages, and our security, contingency disaster recovery, or other risk mitigation plans do not effectively mitigate these occurrences on a timely basis, we may experience a material disruption in our ability to manage our business operations and produce financial reports, as well as significant costs and lost business opportunities until they are remediated. Additionally, while we have insurance coverage designed to address certain aspects of cyber risks in place, such insurance coverage may be insufficient to cover all losses or all types of claims that may arise. \\n\\nWe are also subject to a variety of laws and regulations regarding data privacy, data protection, and data security, including laws related to the collection, storage, handling, use, disclosure, transfer, and security of personal information. Data privacy regulations continue to evolve, and non-compliance with such regulations could subject the Company to legal claims or proceedings, potential regulatory fines and penalties and damage to our reputation. These factors may adversely impact our business, results of operations, and financial condition, as well as our competitive position. \\n\\nChanges in tax laws or exposure to additional tax liabilities could have a material impact on our financial condition and results of operations. \\n\\nWe are subject to income taxes as well as non-income taxes in various jurisdictions throughout the world. Tax authorities may disagree with certain positions we have taken and assess additional taxes, along with interest and penalties. We regularly assess the likely outcomes of these audits and assessments in order to assess the appropriateness of our tax assets and liabilities. However, the calculation of such liabilities involves significant judgment in the interpretation of complex tax regulations in many jurisdictions. Therefore, any dispute with a taxing authority may result in a payment or outcome that is significantly different from current estimates. There can be no assurance that we will accurately predict the outcomes of these audits and the actual outcomes of these audits could have a material impact on our consolidated earnings and financial condition in the periods in which they are recognized. \\n\\nAdditionally, changes in tax laws could materially impact our effective tax rate and the monetization of recoverable tax assets (indirect tax credits). Furthermore, the ongoing efforts in corporate tax transparency by the Organization of Economic Cooperation and Development (\"OECD\") and a number of countries has resulted in additional mandatory disclosures, which will likely cause additional scrutiny of the Company\\'s tax positions and potentially increased tax assessments. Additionally, during 2022 increased grain and food prices globally have resulted in a limited number of jurisdictions calling for a &#8220;windfall profits&#8221; tax on agricultural grain traders and producers. So far, only one jurisdiction has implemented such tax, which is set to expire after 2023. This tax did not have a material impact on Bunge. \\n\\nOur operations are dependent on a wide array of third parties. \\n\\nThe success of our supply chain relies on the continued performance of a wide array of third parties. Suppliers, vendors, co-manufacturers, third-party outsourcers, warehousing partners, and transportation providers are among our critical business partners. Although we take steps to qualify and audit third parties with whom we do business, we cannot guarantee that all third parties will perform dependably or at all. It is possible that events beyond our control, such as financial issues, operational failures, labor issues, cybersecurity events, pandemics (including the COVID-19 pandemic) or other public health issues, or other systemic issues could impact our unaffiliated third parties. If our third parties fail to deliver on their commitments, introduce unplanned risk to our operations, such as exposing us to cybersecurity-related compromises, or are unable to fulfill their obligations, we could experience manufacturing challenges, shipment delays, increased costs, or lost revenue. \\n\\nTabl e of Contents \\n\\nWe are dependent on our executive management and other key personnel. \\n\\nOur success depends on our executive management team and other key personnel with skills upon which our business depends, and our ability to effectively identify, attract, retain, and motivate high quality employees, and replace those who retire or resign. We believe that we have an experienced and highly qualified executive management team, and the loss of service of any one or more of these key personnel could have a significant adverse impact on our operations and our future profitability. Failure to retain and motivate our executive management team and to hire, retain, and develop other important personnel, which may be particularly challenging given the current dynamics in certain labor markets in which we operate, could generally impact other levels of our management and operations, as well as our ability to execute our strategies and may adversely affect our business and results of operations. \\n\\n',\n",
       " 'Risks Relating to the Redomestication ': '\\n\\nOn December 8, 2022, we announced our intention to change the place of incorporation of our ultimate parent company from Bermuda to Switzerland. The Redomestication is subject to various conditions, including shareholder approval, which we expect to seek in 2023. In connection with calling a special meeting of shareholders to seek the shareholder approval required for the Redomestication, we filed a preliminary proxy statement with the SEC on December 21, 2022 and we expect to file a proxy statement in definitive form and hold a special meeting of shareholders in 2023. Please carefully review the preliminary proxy statement and the proxy statement in definitive form when it becomes available, as they contain important information about the Redomestication and Bunge. \\n\\nThe rights of the holders of our common shares will change as a result of the Redomestication. \\n\\nCurrently, the rights of the holders of our common shares are governed by Bermuda law and our memorandum of association and bye-laws. After the Redomestication, the rights of the holders of our common shares will be governed by Swiss law, including new articles of association and organizational regulations, which will be different from Bermuda law and our current memorandum of association and bye-laws in a number of important ways. The following is a list of certain of the rights of the holders of our common shares that will change if the Redomestication is completed: \\n\\n&#8226; Voting threshold for business combinations. Our bye-laws currently provide that merger or consolidation with another company, or the sale of substantially all assets of the Company must be approved by a majority of the votes cast. Under Swiss law, a statutory merger or the sale of substantially all assets requires at least 66 2/3% of the registered shares and a majority of the par value of the registered shares, each as represented at a meeting of shareholders, to vote in favor of the transaction. \\n\\n&#8226; Action by unanimous written consent. Our bye-laws currently provide that shareholders may take action by unanimous written consent in lieu of a general meeting of shareholders. After the Redomestication, our articles of association will provide that shareholders are not permitted to act by written consent in lieu of a meeting of shareholders. \\n\\n&#8226; Bye-law amendments . Many of the rights and obligations of Bunge and its shareholders that are currently contained in Bunge&#8217;s bye-laws will be included in Bunge&#8217;s organizational regulations under Swiss law. Under Swiss law, a company&#8217;s organizational regulations may be amended by the board of directors without seeking shareholder approval, whereas under Bermuda law, amendments to the bye-laws require board and shareholder approval. \\n\\nThe foregoing description of the changes to the rights of the holders of our common shares does not purport to be complete. For more information, see &#8220; Comparison of Rights of Shareholders &#8221; in Bunge&#8217;s preliminary proxy statement filed with the SEC in connection with the Redomestication, which provides a comparison of current rights of Bunge shareholders under Bermuda law to the expected rights of Bunge shareholders under Swiss law following the Redomestication. \\n\\nAs a result of increased shareholder approval requirements, we will have less flexibility with respect to certain aspects of capital management. \\n\\nCurrently, our Board of Directors is permitted to authorize the repurchase of our issued and outstanding common shares without seeking shareholder approval. In certain rare circumstances following the Redomestication, we may be required to seek shareholder approval to repurchase large quantities of our issued and outstanding common shares; however, we do not presently anticipate this to be a likely scenario. Our ability to repurchase our shares is an important component of our capital management and shareholder return practices that we believe is important to our shareholders, and any restriction on our ability to repurchase our shares could make our common shares less attractive to investors. \\n\\nUnder our current bye-laws, our Board of Directors may issue, without shareholder approval, any common shares authorized in our memorandum of association that are not issued or reserved. Bermuda law and our current bye-laws also provide substantial flexibility in establishing the terms of new classes of preferred shares. In addition, our Board of Directors has the right, subject to statutory limitations, to declare and pay dividends on our common shares without a shareholder vote. \\n\\nTabl e of Contents \\n\\nSwiss law allows shareholders to authorize the Board of Directors with the ability to approve increases in stated share capital by up to 50%. Under Swiss law, the authority given to the Board of Directors to issue shares for such purposes must be renewed by the shareholders every five years. Additionally, Swiss law grants existing shareholders preemptive rights to subscribe for newly issued shares and advance subscription rights to subscribe for convertible and similar financial instruments. Preemptive rights and advance subscription rights may be limited or withdrawn for valid reasons. Swiss law also does not provide as much flexibility in the various terms that can attach to different classes of shares. Given that our stock exchange listing with the NYSE will continue following the Redomestication, our ability to issue share capital without additional shareholder approval will remain limited to 20% of the stated share capital. \\n\\nSwiss law also reserves for approval by shareholders many corporate actions over which our Board of Directors currently has authority. For example, dividends must be approved by shareholders. While we do not believe that the differences between Bermuda law and Swiss law relating to our capital management will have an adverse effect on us, we cannot assure you that situations will not arise where such flexibility would have provided substantial benefits to our shareholders. \\n\\nAfter the completion of the Redomestication, we may not be able to make distributions or repurchase shares without subjecting you to Swiss withholding tax. \\n\\nUnder current Swiss law, distributions made out of qualifying capital contribution reserves recognized by the Swiss Federal Tax Administration or made in the form of a par value reduction are not subject to Swiss withholding tax. However, there can be no assurances that the Swiss withholding tax rules will not be changed in the future or that shareholders will approve a distribution out of qualifying capital contribution reserves recognized by the Swiss Federal Tax Administration or a reduction in par value for distributions. Further, over the long term, the amount of par value and qualifying capital contribution reserves available for us may be limited. If we are unable to make a distribution out of qualifying capital contribution reserves or through a reduction in par value, then any dividends paid by us will generally be subject to a Swiss withholding tax at a rate of 35%. The withholding tax must be withheld from the gross distribution and paid to the Swiss Federal Tax Administration. A U.S. holder that qualifies for benefits under the Convention between the United States of America and the Swiss Confederation for the Avoidance of Double Taxation with Respect to Taxes on Income, which we refer to as the &#8220;U.S.-Swiss Treaty,&#8221; may apply for a refund of the tax withheld in excess of the 15% treaty rate (or for a full refund in case of qualified pension funds). Switzerland currently has concluded more than 70 tax treaties with the same treatment regarding the refund of Swiss withholding taxes. Dividends, if any, paid on our shares are not currently subject to withholding tax in Bermuda. \\n\\nUnder current Swiss law, repurchases of shares for the purposes of capital reduction are treated as a partial liquidation subject to 35% Swiss withholding tax on the difference between the par value plus qualifying capital contributions reserves and the repurchase price. Over the long term, the amount of par value and qualifying contribution reserves available for us may be limited. We may follow a share repurchase process for future share repurchases, if any, whereby Swiss institutional investors purchase shares from you and then sell the shares to us and apply for a refund of the Swiss withholding tax. However, if we are unable to use this process successfully, we may not be able to repurchase shares for the purposes of capital reduction without subjecting you to Swiss withholding taxes. See &#8220; Certain Tax Considerations&#8212;Swiss Tax Considerations&#8212;Consequences to Shareholders of Bunge-Switzerland Subsequent to the Redomestication&#8212;Repurchases of Shares\" of the Preliminary Proxy Statement. \\n\\nThe Redomestication will result in additional costs to us, some of which will be incurred regardless of whether the Redomestication is completed. \\n\\nThe completion of the Redomestication will result in an increase in some of our ongoing expenses and require us to incur some new expenses in connection with the Redomestication regardless of whether the Redomestication is completed. \\n\\nWe are seeking amendments to certain of our credit facilities and our trade receivable securitization program in parallel with the Redomestication. Failure to do so could have an adverse effect on our ability to complete the Redomestication or on our business, results of operations, or financial condition after the completion of the Redomestication. \\n\\nUpon the completion of the Redomestication, a &#8220;change of control&#8221; constituting an event of default may be deemed to have occurred under the terms of the bank credit agreements governing our unsecured $1.1 billion 364-day Revolving Credit Agreement, unsecured committed $1.35 billion 5-year Revolving Credit Agreement, unsecured $865 million 5-year Revolving Credit Agreement, unsecured $1.75 billion 3-year Revolving Credit Facility, $750 million Term Loan facility, $250 million February 2023 Delayed Draw Term Loan Facility, $250 million October 2022 Delayed Draw Term Loan Facility, &#165;30.7 billion Term Loan Facility, $90 million Term Loan Facility, and $600 million commercial paper program of our wholly-owned subsidiaries. These agreements permit acceleration of the borrowings under such facilities upon such an event of default. We also guarantee certain local credit lines and other financial arrangements of our subsidiaries in which consent may be required. We are seeking amendments to these facilities from our lenders to assign our obligations as guarantor thereunder to the Swiss corporation to be incorporated in connection with the Redomestication (&#8220;Bunge-Switzerland&#8221;), although we may not be able to obtain the creditor consents required to successfully amend any or all of these facilities. In addition, we and certain of our \\n\\nTabl e of Contents \\n\\nsubsidiaries participate in a trade receivable securitization program that provides for funding up to $1.1 billion against receivables sold into such program. We are seeking amendments to assign our obligations thereunder to Bunge-Switzerland. \\n\\nWe do not expect to incur significant costs in connection with obtaining these consents or taking these actions. However, the failure to amend some or all of these facilities could have an adverse effect on our ability to complete the Redomestication or on our business, results of operations, or financial condition after the completion of the Redomestication. \\n\\nBunge has senior notes outstanding in the aggregate amount of $3,735 million as of December 31, 2022 which are guaranteed by Bunge Limited. The indentures provide a provision for a successor guarantor domiciled in various countries including Switzerland with no consent required from the noteholders. We expect no other changes to the indentures and economics to the noteholders. We do expect to deliver a notice of the successor guarantor to the bond trustee. \\n\\nUpon completion of the Redomestication, we may qualify as a foreign private issuer and be exempt from certain U.S. securities laws and permitted to publicly disclose less information than U.S. public companies are required to disclose. If we qualify for and choose to utilize these exemptions, our shareholders may no longer have access to information they deem important, which may result in our common shares being less attractive to investors. \\n\\nWe do not currently believe that we will qualify as a &#8220;foreign private issuer&#8221; within the meaning of the rules promulgated by the Exchange Act, upon completion of the Redomestication. The definition of a &#8220;foreign private issuer&#8221; has two parts&#8212;one based on a company&#8217;s percentage of U.S. resident shareholders and the other on its business contacts with the United States. An organization incorporated under the laws of a foreign country qualifies as a foreign private issuer if either part of the definition is satisfied. We do not expect to qualify as a foreign private issuer under the shareholder test because we currently expect that more than 50% of our outstanding voting securities will continue to be held by U.S. residents after the completion of the Redomestication. However, under the business contacts test, if it were the case after the Redomestication that (1) more than 50% of our assets were located outside the United States, (2) our business was not administered principally in the United States and (3) a majority of our executive officers and directors were neither U.S. citizens nor U.S. residents, then we would qualify as a foreign private issuer. We do not expect that we will meet the requirements of clause (3) of this test upon the completion of the Redomestication, as we believe a majority of our executive officers and directors will continue to be U.S. citizens or U.S. residents. However, we may satisfy this element of the test sometime in the future and, as a result, qualify for status as a foreign private issuer at such later date. If and when that occurs, we would be exempt from certain requirements applicable to U.S. public companies, including: \\n\\n&#8226; the rules requiring the filing of Quarterly Reports on Form 10-Q and Current Reports on Form 8-K with the SEC, \\n\\n&#8226; the SEC&#8217;s rules regulating proxy solicitations, \\n\\n&#8226; the provisions of Regulation FD, \\n\\n&#8226; the filing of reports of beneficial ownership under Section 16 of the Exchange Act (although beneficial ownership reports may be required under Section 13 of the Exchange Act), and \\n\\n&#8226; &#8220;short-swing&#8221; trading liability imposed on insiders who purchase and sell securities within a six-month period. \\n\\nIn addition, we would then be allowed to: \\n\\n&#8226; file annual reports within six months after the end of a fiscal year, \\n\\n&#8226; include more limited executive compensation disclosure in our filings with the SEC, \\n\\n&#8226; apply accounting principles other than U.S. GAAP to our financial statements, although reconciliation to U.S. GAAP would be required if International Financial Reporting Standards as adopted by the International Accounting Standards Board are not used, and \\n\\n&#8226; choose which reporting currency to use in presenting our financial statements. \\n\\nIf we choose to utilize these exemptions, our shareholders may no longer have access to information they deem important, which may result in our common shares being less attractive to investors. \\n\\n',\n",

As a result, the rights of holders of our common shares will be governed by Bermuda law and our memorandum of association and bye-laws. The rights of shareholders under Bermuda law may differ from the rights of shareholders of companies or corporations incorporated in other jurisdictions, including the United States. Several of our directors and some of our officers are non-residents of the United States, and a substantial portion of our assets and the assets of those directors and officers are located outside the United States. As a result, it may be difficult to effect service of process on those persons in the United States or to enforce in the United States judgments obtained in U.S. courts against us or those persons based on civil liability provisions of the U.S. securities laws. It is doubtful whether courts in \\n\\nTabl e of Contents \\n\\nBermuda will enforce judgments obtained in other jurisdictions, including the United States, against us or our directors or officers under the securities laws of those jurisdictions or entertain actions in Bermuda against us or our directors or officers under the securities laws of other jurisdictions. \\n\\nOur bye-laws restrict shareholders from bringing legal action against our officers and directors. \\n\\nOur bye-laws contain a broad waiver by our shareholders of any claim or right of action, both individually and on our behalf, against any of our officers or directors. The waiver applies to any action taken by an officer or director, or the failure of an officer or director to take any action, in the performance of his or her duties, except with respect to any matter involving any fraud or dishonesty on the part of the officer or director. This waiver limits the right of shareholders to assert claims against our officers and directors unless the act, or failure to act, involves fraud or dishonesty. \\n\\nWe have anti-takeover provisions in our bye-laws that may discourage a change of control. \\n\\nOur bye-laws contain provisions that could make it more difficult for a third party to acquire us without the consent of our Board of Directors.

The increase in amortization expense in 2023 was a result of $ 7 million of accelerated amortization expense on customer relationships in the fourth quarter due to the loss of certain contract manufacturing customers. As of July 30, 2023, amortizable intangible assets had a weighted-average remaining useful life of 15 years. Amortization expense is estimated to be approximately $ 68 million in 2024, $ 59 million in 2025 and $ 34 million per year for the following three years. \\n\\nAs of the 2023 annual impairment testing, indefinite-lived trademarks with approximately 10% or less of excess coverage of fair value over carrying value had an aggregate carrying value of $ 434 million and included the Pacific Foods and certain other Snacks trademarks. \\n\\nThe estimates of future cash flows used in determining the fair value of goodwill and intangible assets involve significant management judgment and are based upon assumptions about expected future operating performance, economic conditions, market conditions and cost of capital.

Unrealized gains and losses on outstanding undesignated commodity hedging activities are excluded from segment \\n\\noperating earnings and are recorded in Corporate as these open positions represent hedges of future purchases.

Restructuring Charges and Cost Savings Initiatives \\n\\nMulti-year Cost Savings Initiatives and Snyder's-Lance Cost Transformation Program and Integration \\n\\nContinuing Operations \\n\\nBeginning in fiscal 2015, we implemented initiatives to reduce costs and to streamline our organizational structure. \\n\\nOver the years, we expanded these initiatives by continuing to optimize our supply chain and manufacturing networks, as well as our information technology infrastructure. \", \"On March 26, 2018, we completed the acquisition of Snyder's-Lance. Prior to the acquisition, Snyder's-Lance launched a cost transformation program following a comprehensive review of its operations with the goal of significantly improving its financial performance. We continued to implement this program and identified opportunities for additional cost synergies as we integrated Snyder's-Lance. \", \"In 2022, we expanded these initiatives as we continue to pursue cost savings by further optimizing our supply chain and manufacturing network and through effective cost management. In the second quarter of 2023, we announced plans to consolidate our Snacks offices in Charlotte, North Carolina, and Norwalk, Connecticut, into our headquarters in Camden, New Jersey. Cost estimates for these expanded initiatives, as well as timing for certain activities, are continuing to be developed. \\n\\nA summary of the pre-tax charges recorded in the Consolidated Statements of Earnings related to these initiatives is as follows:  (Millions) 2023 2022 2021 Recognized as of July 30, 2023 \\n\\nRestructuring charges $ 16 \\xa0 $ 5 \\xa0 $ 21 \\xa0 $ 280 \\xa0 Administrative expenses 24 \\xa0 20 \\xa0 28 \\xa0 383 \\xa0 Cost of products sold 18 \\xa0 5 \\xa0 3 \\xa0 102 \\xa0 Marketing and selling expenses 5 \\xa0 1 \\xa0 1 \\xa0 19 \\xa0 Research and development expenses 3 \\xa0 — \\xa0 — \\xa0 7 \\xa0 Total pre-tax charges $ 66 \\xa0 $ 31 \\xa0 $ 53 \\xa0 $ 791 \\xa0 \\n\\nA summary of the pre-tax costs associated with these initiatives is as follows: \\n\\n (Millions) Recognized as of \\n\\nJuly 30, 2023 \\n\\nSeverance pay and benefits \\n\\n$ 240 \\xa0 Asset impairment/accelerated depreciation 106 \\xa0 \\n\\nImplementation costs and other related costs \\n\\n445 \\xa0 Total $ 791 \\xa0 \\n\\nThe total estimated pre-tax costs for actions that have been identified are approximately $ 885 million to $ 905 million and we expect to incur the costs through 2025. These estimates will be updated as the expanded initiatives are developed. \\n\\nWe expect the costs for actions that have been identified to date to consist of the following: approximately $ 245 million to $ 250 million in severance pay and benefits; approximately $ 140 million in asset impairment and accelerated depreciation; and approximately $ 500 million to $ 515 million in implementation costs and other related costs. We expect these pre-tax costs to be associated with our segments as follows: Meals & Beverages - approximately 32 %; Snacks - approximately 43 %; and Corporate - approximately 25 %. \\n\\nOf the aggregate $ 885 million to $ 905 million of pre-tax costs identified to date, we expect approximately $ 705 million to $ 725 million will be cash expenditures. In addition, we expect to invest approximately $ 620 million in capital expenditures through 2025, of which we invested $ 467 million as of July 30, 2023. The capital expenditures primarily relate to optimization of production within our Meals & Beverages manufacturing network, a U.S. warehouse optimization project, improvement of quality, safety and cost structure across the Snyder’s-Lance manufacturing network, optimization of information technology infrastructure and applications, implementation of our existing SAP enterprise-resource planning system for Snyder's-Lance, enhancements to our headquarters in Camden, New Jersey, and optimization of the Snyder’s-Lance warehouse and distribution network. \\n\\nA summary of the restructuring activity and related reserves at July 30, 2023, is as follows: \\n\\n (Millions) Severance Pay and Benefits Implementation Costs and Other Related Costs (3) \\n\\nAsset Impairment/Accelerated Depreciation Other Non-Cash Exit Costs (4) \\n\\nTotal Charges \\n\\nAccrued balance at August 1, 2021 (1) \\n\\n$ 7 \\xa0 2022 charges \\n\\n5 \\xa0 26 \\xa0 — \\xa0 — \\xa0 $ 31 \\xa0 2022 cash payments \\n\\n( 5 ) \\n\\nAccrued balance at July 31, 2022 \\n\\n$ 7 \\xa0 2023 charges \\n\\n13 \\xa0 26 \\xa0 24 \\xa0 3 \\xa0 $ 66 \\xa0 2023 cash payments \\n\\n( 7 ) \\n\\nAccrued balance at July 30, 2023 (2) \\n\\n$ 13 \\xa0 \\n\\n_______________________________________ \\n\\n(1) Includes $ 1 million of severance pay and benefits recorded in Other liabilities in the Consolidated Balance Sheet. \\n\\n(2) Includes $ 7 million of severance pay and benefits recorded in Other liabilities in the Consolidated Balance Sheet. \\n\\n(3) Includes other costs recognized as incurred that are not reflected in the restructuring reserves in the Consolidated Balance Sheets.

Earnings per Share (EPS) \\n\\nFor the periods presented in the Consolidated Statements of Earnings, the calculations of basic EPS and EPS assuming dilution vary in that the weighted average shares outstanding assuming dilution include the incremental effect of stock options and other share-based payment awards, except when such effect would be antidilutive. The earnings per share calculation for 2023 excludes less than 1 million stock options that would have been antidilutive. The earnings per share calculation for 2022 and 2021 excludes approximately 1 million stock options that would have been antidilutive. \\n\\n9. Pension and Postretirement Benefits \\n\\nPension Benefits — We sponsor a number of noncontributory defined benefit pension plans to provide retirement benefits to eligible U.S. and non-U.S. employees. The benefits provided under these plans are based primarily on years of service and compensation levels. Benefits are paid from funds previously provided to trustees or are paid directly by us from general funds. In 1999, we implemented significant amendments to certain U.S. pension plans. Under a new formula, retirement benefits are determined based on percentages of annual pay and age. To minimize the impact of converting to the new formula, service and earnings credit continued to accrue for fifteen years for certain active employees participating in the plans under the old formula prior to the amendments. Employees will receive the benefit from either the new or old formula, whichever is higher. Effective as of January 1, 2011, our U.S. pension plans were amended so that employees hired or rehired on or after that date and who are not covered by collective bargaining agreements will not be eligible to participate in the plans. All collective bargaining units adopted this amendment by December 31, 2011. \\n\\nIn June 2023, we settled $ 245 million of our pension benefit obligations associated with approximately 6,000 retired participants currently receiving benefits within our U.S. defined benefit pension plans. A group annuity contract was purchased on behalf of these participants with a third-party insurance provider and funded directly by $ 241 million from the assets of our pension plans, resulting in an actuarial gain of $ 4 million. \\n\\nPostretirement Benefits — We provide postretirement benefits, including health care and life insurance to eligible retired U.S. employees, and where applicable, their dependents. Accordingly, we sponsor a retiree medical program for eligible retired U.S. employees and fund applicable retiree medical accounts intended to provide reimbursement for eligible health care expenses on a tax-favored basis for retirees who satisfy certain eligibility requirements. Effective as of January 1, 2019, we no longer sponsor our own retiree medical coverage for substantially all retired U.S. employees that are Medicare eligible. Instead, we offer these Medicare-eligible retirees access to health care coverage through a private exchange and offer a health reimbursement account to subsidize benefits for a select group of such retirees. We also provide postretirement life insurance to all eligible U.S. employees who retired prior to January 1, 2018, as well as certain eligible retired employees covered by one of our collective bargaining agreements who retired prior to January 1, 2023. \\n\\nDetermining net periodic benefit expense (income) is dependent on various actuarial assumptions, including discount rates, expected return on plan assets, compensation increases, turnover rates and health care trend rates. Actuarial gains and losses are recognized immediately in Other expenses / (income) in the Consolidated Statements of Earnings as of the measurement date, which is our fiscal year end, or more frequently if an interim remeasurement is required. We use the fair value of plan assets to calculate the expected return on plan assets. \\n\\nComponents of net periodic benefit expense (income) were as follows:  Pension Postretirement (Millions) 2023 2022 2021 2023 2022 2021 Service cost $ 13 \\xa0 $ 16 \\xa0 $ 18 \\xa0 $ — \\xa0 $ — \\xa0 $ — \\xa0 Interest cost 73 \\xa0 49 \\xa0 41 \\xa0 7 \\xa0 3 \\xa0 4 \\xa0 Expected return on plan assets ( 100 ) ( 118 ) ( 122 ) — \\xa0 — \\xa0 — \\xa0 Amortization of prior service credit 1 \\xa0 — \\xa0 — \\xa0 ( 1 ) ( 1 ) ( 5 ) Actuarial losses (gains) ( 6 ) 80 \\xa0 ( 197 ) ( 9 ) ( 36 ) ( 6 ) Net periodic benefit expense (income) $ ( 19 ) $ 27 \\xa0 $ ( 260 ) $ ( 3 ) $ ( 34 ) $ ( 7 )  \\n\\nThe components of net periodic benefit expense (income) other than the service cost component are included in Other expenses / (income) in the Consolidated Statements of Earnings. \\n\\nThe pension actuarial gains recognized in 2023 were primarily due to increases in discount rates used to determine the benefit obligation and the gain from the annuity settlement, partially offset by losses on plan assets and plan experience. The pension actuarial losses recognized in 2022 were primarily due to losses on plan assets, partially offset by increases in discount rates used to determine the benefit obligation. The pension actuarial gains recognized in 2021 were primarily due to higher than anticipated investment gains on plan assets and increases in discount rates used to determine the benefit obligation. \\n\\nThe postretirement actuarial gains recognized in 2023, 2022 and 2021 were primarily due to increases in discount rates used to determine the benefit obligation. \\n\\nChange in benefit obligation: \\n\\n Pension Postretirement (Millions) 2023 2022 2023 2022 Obligation at beginning of year $ 1,737 \\xa0 $ 2,186 \\xa0 $ 172 \\xa0 $ 222 \\xa0 Service cost 13 \\xa0 16 \\xa0 — \\xa0 — \\xa0 Interest cost 73 \\xa0 49 \\xa0 7 \\xa0 3 \\xa0 Actuarial losses (gains) ( 108 ) ( 310 ) ( 9 ) ( 36 ) Benefits paid ( 104 ) ( 106 ) ( 17 ) ( 17 ) Settlements ( 352 ) ( 89 ) — \\xa0 — \\xa0 Other — \\xa0 ( 6 ) — \\xa0 — \\xa0 Foreign currency adjustment ( 2 ) ( 3 ) — \\xa0 — \\xa0 Benefit obligation at end of year $ 1,257 \\xa0 $ 1,737 \\xa0 $ 153 \\xa0 $ 172 \\xa0 \\n\\nChange in the fair value of pension plan assets: \\n\\n (Millions) 2023 2022 Fair value at beginning of year $ 1,763 \\xa0 $ 2,220 \\xa0 Actual return on plan assets ( 1 ) ( 272 ) Employer contributions 1 \\xa0 — \\xa0 Benefits paid ( 91 ) ( 92 ) Settlements ( 352 ) ( 89 ) Foreign currency adjustment ( 4 ) ( 4 ) Fair value at end of year $ 1,316 \\xa0 $ 1,763 \\xa0 \\n\\nNet amounts recognized in the Consolidated Balance Sheets: \\n\\n \\xa0 Pension Postretirement (Millions) 2023 2022 2023 2022 Other assets $ 164 \\xa0 $ 146 \\xa0 $ — \\xa0 $ — \\xa0 Accrued liabilities 10 \\xa0 13 \\xa0 18 \\xa0 19 \\xa0 Other liabilities 95 \\xa0 107 \\xa0 135 \\xa0 153 \\xa0 Net amounts recognized asset / (liability) $ 59 \\xa0 $ 26 \\xa0 $ ( 153 ) $ ( 172 ) \\n\\nAmounts recognized in Accumulated other comprehensive income (loss) consist of: \\n\\n (Millions) Pension Postretirement 2023 2022 2023 2022 Prior service credit (cost) $ — \\xa0 $ ( 1 ) $ 3 \\xa0 $ 4 \\xa0 \\n\\nThe change in amounts recognized in Accumulated other comprehensive income (loss) associated with postretirement benefits was due to amortization in 2023 and 2022. \\n\\nThe following table provides information for pension plans with projected benefit obligations in excess of plan assets and accumulated benefit obligations in excess of plan assets: \\n\\n (Millions) 2023 2022 Projected benefit obligation $ 105 \\xa0 $ 120 \\xa0 Accumulated benefit obligation $ 104 \\xa0 $ 118 \\xa0 Fair value of plan assets $ — \\xa0 $ — \\xa0 \\n\\nThe accumulated benefit obligation for all pension plans was $ 1.24 billion at July 30, 2023, and $ 1.716 billion at July 31, 2022. \\n\\nWeighted-average assumptions used to determine benefit obligations at the end of the year: \\n\\n \\xa0 Pension Postretirement \\xa0 2023 2022 2023 2022 Discount rate 5.46 % 4.58 % 5.47 % 4.48 % Rate of compensation increase 3.23 % 3.23 % 3.25 % 3.25 % Interest crediting rate 4.00 % 4.00 % Not applicable \\n\\nWeighted-average assumptions used to determine net periodic benefit cost for the years ended: \\n\\n \\xa0 Pension \\xa0 2023 2022 2021 Discount rate 5.03 % 3.13 % 2.47 % Expected return on plan assets 6.40 % 5.82 % 6.01 % Rate of compensation increase 3.23 % 3.23 % 3.23 % Interest crediting rate 4.00 % 4.00 % 4.00 % \\n\\nThe discount rate is established as of the measurement date. In establishing the discount rate, we review published market indices of high-quality debt securities, adjusted as appropriate for duration. In addition, independent actuaries apply high-quality bond yield curves to the expected benefit payments of the plans. The expected return on plan assets is a long-term assumption based upon historical experience and expected future performance, considering our current and projected investment mix. This estimate is based on an estimate of future inflation, long-term projected real returns for each asset class and a premium for active management. \\n\\nThe discount rate used to determine net periodic postretirement expense was 4.48 % in 2023, 2.37 % in 2022, and 2.15 % in 2021. \\n\\nAssumed health care cost trend rates at the end of the year: \\n\\n \\xa0 2023 2022 Health care cost trend rate assumed for next year 6.50 % 6.50 % Rate to which the cost trend rate is assumed to decline (ultimate trend rate) 5.00 % 5.00 % Year that the rate reaches the ultimate trend rate 2030 2027 \\n\\nPension Plan Assets \\n\\nThe fundamental goal underlying the investment policy is to ensure that the assets of the plans are invested in a prudent manner to meet the obligations of the plans as these obligations come due. The primary investment objectives include providing a total return which will promote the goal of benefit security by attaining an appropriate ratio of plan assets to plan obligations, to provide for real asset growth while also tracking plan obligations, to diversify investments across and within asset classes, to reduce the impact of losses in single investments, and to follow investment practices that comply with applicable laws and regulations. \\n\\nThe primary policy objectives will be met by investing assets to achieve a reasonable tradeoff between return and risk relative to plan obligations. This includes investing a portion of the assets in funds selected in part to hedge the interest rate sensitivity to plan obligations. \\n\\nThe portfolio includes investments in the following asset classes: fixed income, equity, real estate and alternatives. Fixed income will provide a moderate expected return and partially hedge the exposure to interest rate risk of the plans’ obligations. Equities are used for their high expected return. Additional asset classes are used to provide diversification. \\n\\nAsset allocation is monitored on an ongoing basis relative to the established asset class targets. The interaction between plan assets and benefit obligations is periodically studied to assist in the establishment of strategic asset allocation targets. The investment policy permits variances from the targets within certain parameters. Asset rebalancing occurs when the underlying asset class allocations move outside these parameters, at which time the asset allocation is rebalanced back to the policy target weight. \\n\\nOur year-end pension plan weighted-average asset allocations by category were: \\n\\n \\xa0 Strategic Target 2023 2022 Equity securities 26 % 27 % 34 % Debt securities 68 % 66 % 59 % Real estate and other 6 % 7 % 7 % Total 100 % 100 % 100 % \\n\\nPension plan assets are categorized based on the following fair value hierarchy: \\n\\n• Level 1: Observable inputs that reflect quoted prices (unadjusted) for identical assets or liabilities in active markets. \\n\\n• Level 2: Inputs other than quoted prices included in Level 1 that are observable for the asset or liability through corroboration with observable market data. \\n\\n• Level 3: Unobservable inputs, which are valued based on our estimates of assumptions that market participants would use in pricing the asset or liability. \\n\\nThe following table presents our pension plan assets by asset category at July 30, 2023, and July 31, 2022: \\n\\n \\xa0 Fair Value \\n\\nas of \\n\\nJuly 30, 2023 \\n\\nFair Value Measurements at \\n\\nJuly 30, 2023 Using \\n\\nFair Value Hierarchy \\n\\nFair Value \\n\\nas of \\n\\nJuly 31, 2022 \\n\\nFair Value Measurements at \\n\\nJuly 31, 2022 Using \\n\\nFair Value Hierarchy \\n\\n(Millions) Level 1 Level 2 Level 3 Level 1 Level 2 Level 3 Short-term investments \\n\\n$ 7 \\xa0 $ 3 \\xa0 $ 4 \\xa0 $ — \\xa0 $ 33 \\xa0 $ 27 \\xa0 $ 6 \\xa0 $ — Equities: U.S. 53 \\xa0 51 \\xa0 2 \\xa0 — \\xa0 78 \\xa0 75 \\xa0 3 \\xa0 — Non-U.S. 116 \\xa0 115 \\xa0 1 \\xa0 — \\xa0 162 \\xa0 162 \\xa0 — \\xa0 — Corporate bonds: U.S. 448 \\xa0 — \\xa0 448 \\xa0 — \\xa0 571 \\xa0 — 571 \\xa0 — Non-U.S. 87 \\xa0 — \\xa0 87 \\xa0 — \\xa0 119 \\xa0 — 119 \\xa0 — Government and agency bonds: \\n\\nU.S. 183 \\xa0 — \\xa0 183 \\xa0 — \\xa0 224 \\xa0 — 224 \\xa0 — Non-U.S. 14 \\xa0 — \\xa0 14 \\xa0 — \\xa0 20 \\xa0 — 20 \\xa0 — Municipal bonds 15 \\xa0 — \\xa0 15 \\xa0 — \\xa0 19 \\xa0 — 19 \\xa0 — Mortgage and asset backed securities \\n\\n19 \\xa0 — \\xa0 19 \\xa0 — \\xa0 15 \\xa0 — 15 \\xa0 — Real estate 2 \\xa0 1 \\xa0 — \\xa0 1 \\xa0 4 \\xa0 2 \\xa0 — 2 \\xa0 Hedge funds 8 \\xa0 — \\xa0 — \\xa0 8 \\xa0 11 \\xa0 — — 11 \\xa0 Derivative assets 4 \\xa0 — \\xa0 4 \\xa0 — \\xa0 10 \\xa0 — 10 \\xa0 — Derivative liabilities ( 3 ) — \\xa0 ( 3 ) — \\xa0 ( 5 ) — ( 5 ) — Total assets at fair value \\n\\n$ 953 \\xa0 $ 170 \\xa0 $ 774 \\xa0 $ 9 \\xa0 $ 1,261 \\xa0 $ 266 \\xa0 $ 982 \\xa0 $ 13 \\xa0 Investments measured at net asset value: \\n\\nShort-term investments \\n\\n$ 69 \\xa0 $ 27 \\xa0 Commingled equity funds 158 \\xa0 307 \\xa0 Commingled fixed income funds 79 \\xa0 87 \\xa0 Real estate 73 \\xa0 99 \\xa0 Hedge funds 2 \\xa0 14 \\xa0 Total investments measured at net asset value: \\n\\n$ 381 \\xa0 $ 534 \\xa0 Other items to reconcile to fair value \\n\\n( 18 ) ( 32 ) Total pension plan assets at fair value \\n\\n$ 1,316 \\xa0 $ 1,763 \\xa0 \\n\\nShort-term investments — Investments include cash and cash equivalents, and various short-term debt instruments and short-term investment funds. Institutional short-term investment vehicles valued daily are classified as Level 1 at cost which \\n\\napproximates market value.

Other investments valued based upon net asset value are included as a reconciling item to the fair value table. \\n\\nEquities — Generally common stocks and preferred stocks are classified as Level 1 and are valued using quoted market prices in active markets. \\n\\nCorporate bonds — These investments are valued based on quoted market prices, yield curves and pricing models using current market rates. \\n\\nGovernment and agency bonds — These investments are generally valued based on bid quotations and recent trade data for identical or similar obligations. \\n\\nMunicipal bonds — These investments are valued based on quoted market prices, yield curves and pricing models using current market rates. \\n\\nMortgage and asset backed securities — These investments are valued based on prices obtained from third party pricing sources. The prices from third party pricing sources may be based on bid quotes from dealers and recent trade data. Mortgage backed securities are traded in the over-the-counter market. \\n\\nReal estate — Real estate investments consist of real estate investment trusts, property funds and limited partnerships. Real estate investment trusts are classified as Level 1 and are valued based on quoted market prices. Property funds are classified as either Level 2 or Level 3 depending upon whether liquidity is limited or there are few observable market participant transactions. Property funds are valued based on third party appraisals. Limited partnerships are valued based upon valuations provided by the general partners of the funds. The values of limited partnerships are based upon an assessment of each underlying investment, incorporating valuations that consider the evaluation of financing and sales transactions with third parties, expected cash flows and market-based information, including comparable transactions and performance multiples among other factors. The investments are classified as Level 3 since the valuation is determined using unobservable inputs. Real estate investments valued at net asset value are included as a reconciling item to the fair value table. \\n\\nHedge funds — Hedge fund investments include hedge funds valued based upon a net asset value derived from the fair value of underlying securities. Hedge fund investments that are subject to liquidity restrictions or that are based on unobservable inputs are classified as Level 3. Hedge fund investments may include long and short positions in equity and fixed income securities, derivative instruments such as futures and options, commodities and other types of securities. Hedge fund investments valued at net asset value are included as a reconciling item to the fair value table. \\n\\nDerivatives — Derivative financial instruments include forward currency contracts, futures contracts, options contracts, interest rate swaps and credit default swaps. Derivative financial instruments are classified as Level 2 and are valued based on observable market transactions or prices. \\n\\nCommingled funds — Investments in commingled funds are not traded in active markets. Commingled funds are valued based on the net asset values of such funds and are included as a reconciling item to the fair value table. \\n\\nOther items to reconcile to fair value of plan assets included amounts due for securities sold, amounts payable for securities purchased and other payables. \\n\\nThe following table summarizes the changes in fair value of Level 3 investments for the years ended July 30, 2023, and July 31, 2022: \\n\\n (Millions) Real Estate Hedge Funds Total \\n\\nFair value at July 31, 2022 \\n\\n$ 2 \\xa0 $ 11 \\xa0 $ 13 \\xa0 Actual return on plan assets — \\xa0 ( 1 ) ( 1 ) Purchases, sales and settlements, net ( 1 ) ( 2 ) ( 3 ) Transfers out of Level 3 — \\xa0 — \\xa0 — \\xa0 \\n\\nFair value at July 30, 2023 \\n\\n$ 1 \\xa0 $ 8 \\xa0 $ 9 \\xa0 \\n\\n (Millions) Real Estate Hedge Funds Total \\n\\nFair value at August 1, 2021 \\n\\n$ 3 \\xa0 $ 30 \\xa0 $ 33 \\xa0 Actual return on plan assets — \\xa0 1 \\xa0 1 \\xa0 Purchases, sales and settlements, net ( 1 ) ( 20 ) ( 21 ) Transfers out of Level 3 — \\xa0 — \\xa0 — \\xa0 \\n\\nFair value at July 31, 2022 \\n\\n$ 2 \\xa0 $ 11 \\xa0 $ 13 \\xa0 \\n\\nEstimated future benefit payments are as follows: \\n\\n (Millions) Pension Postretirement 2024 $ 127 \\xa0 $ 19 \\xa0 2025 $ 118 \\xa0 $ 17 \\xa0 2026 $ 115 \\xa0 $ 16 \\xa0 2027 $ 110 \\xa0 $ 15 \\xa0 2028 $ 107 \\xa0 $ 14 \\xa0 2029-2033 $ 486 \\xa0 $ 60 \\xa0 \\n\\nThe estimated future benefit payments include payments from funded and unfunded plans. \\n\\nWe do not expect contributions to pension plans to be material in 2024. \\n\\nDefined Contribution Plans — We sponsor a 401(k) Retirement Plan that covers substantially all U.S. employees and provide a matching contribution of 100 % of employee contributions up to 4 % of eligible compensation. In addition, for employees not eligible to participate in defined benefit plans that we sponsor, we provide a contribution equal to 3 % of eligible compensation regardless of their participation in the 401(k) Retirement Plan.

The IRA introduces a corporate alternative minimum tax beginning in 2024, a 1% excise tax on share repurchases in excess of issuances after January 1, 2023, and several tax incentives to promote clean energy. Any excise tax incurred is recognized as part of the cost basis of the shares acquired in the Consolidated Statements of Equity. We do not expect the provisions of the IRA to have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements. \\n\\nDeferred tax liabilities and assets are comprised of the following: \\n\\n (Millions) 2023 2022 Depreciation $ 340 \\xa0 $ 354 \\xa0 Amortization 881 \\xa0 870 \\xa0 Operating lease ROU assets 69 \\xa0 54 \\xa0 Pension 39 \\xa0 35 \\xa0 Other 8 \\xa0 9 \\xa0 Deferred tax liabilities 1,337 \\xa0 1,322 \\xa0 Benefits and compensation 112 \\xa0 119 \\xa0 Pension benefits 25 \\xa0 28 \\xa0 Tax loss carryforwards 10 \\xa0 13 \\xa0 Capital loss carryforwards 114 \\xa0 115 \\xa0 Operating lease liabilities 69 \\xa0 54 \\xa0 Capitalized research and development 15 \\xa0 — \\xa0 Other 56 \\xa0 52 \\xa0 Gross deferred tax assets 401 \\xa0 381 \\xa0 Deferred tax asset valuation allowance ( 129 ) ( 131 ) Deferred tax assets, net of valuation allowance 272 \\xa0 250 \\xa0 Net deferred tax liability $ 1,065 \\xa0 $ 1,072 \\xa0 \\n\\nAt July 30, 2023, our U.S. and non-U.S. subsidiaries had tax loss carryforwards of approximately $ 192 million. Of these carryforwards, $ 4 million may be carried forward indefinitely, and $ 188 million expire between 2024 and 2037, with the majority expiring after 2028. At July 30, 2023, deferred tax asset valuation allowances have been established to offset $ 40 million of these tax loss carryforwards. Additionally, as of July 30, 2023, our U.S. and non-U.S. subsidiaries had capital loss carryforwards of approximately $ 474 million, all of which were offset by valuation allowances. Of these capital loss carryforwards, $ 349 million expire in 2024, $ 77 million expire in 2026, and $ 48 million may be carried forward indefinitely. \\n\\nThe net change in the deferred tax asset valuation allowance in 2023 was a decrease of $ 2 million. The decrease was primarily due to state tax loss carryforwards. The net change in the deferred tax asset valuation allowance in 2022 was a decrease of $ 11 million. The decrease was primarily due to the liquidation of an inactive subsidiary. The net change in the deferred tax asset valuation allowance in 2021 was an increase of $ 20 million. The increase was primarily due to the sale of the Plum baby food and snacks business. \\n\\nAs of July 30, 2023, other deferred tax assets included $ 12 million of state tax credit carryforwards related to various states that expire in 2025. As of July 31, 2022, other deferred tax assets included $ 13 million of state tax credit carryforwards. As of July 30, 2023, and July 31, 2022, deferred tax asset valuation allowances have been established to offset the state tax credit carryforwards. \\n\\nAs of July 30, 2023, we had approximately $ 11 million of undistributed earnings of foreign subsidiaries which are deemed to be permanently reinvested and for which we have not recognized a deferred tax liability. We estimate that the tax liability that might be incurred if permanently reinvested earnings were remitted to the U.S. would not be material. Foreign subsidiary earnings in 2021 and thereafter are not considered permanently reinvested and we have therefore recognized a deferred tax liability and expense. \\n\\nA reconciliation of the activity related to unrecognized tax benefits follows: \\n\\n (Millions) 2023 2022 2021 Balance at beginning of year $ 14 \\xa0 $ 22 \\xa0 $ 23 \\xa0 Increases related to prior-year tax positions — \\xa0 4 \\xa0 — \\xa0 Decreases related to prior-year tax positions — \\xa0 ( 10 ) ( 1 ) Increases related to current-year tax positions 2 \\xa0 1 \\xa0 3 \\xa0 Settlements — \\xa0 ( 2 ) — \\xa0 Lapse of statute ( 1 ) ( 1 ) ( 3 ) Balance at end of year $ 15 \\xa0 $ 14 \\xa0 $ 22 \\xa0 \\n\\nThe increase of unrecognized tax benefits was primarily due current-year tax positions. The amount of unrecognized tax benefits that, if recognized, would impact the annual effective tax rate was $ 12 million as of July 30, 2023, and July 31, 2022, and $ 18 million as of August 1, 2021. The total amount of unrecognized tax benefits can change due to audit settlements, tax examination activities, statute expirations and the recognition and measurement criteria under accounting for uncertainty in income taxes. \\n\\nOur accounting policy for interest and penalties attributable to income taxes is to reflect any expense or benefit as a component of our income tax provision. The total amount of interest and penalties recognized in the Consolidated Statements of Earnings was not material in 2023, 2022, and 2021. The total amount of interest and penalties recognized in the Consolidated Balance Sheets in Other liabilities was $ 5 million as of July 30, 2023, and $ 4 million as of July 31, 2022. \\n\\nWe file income tax returns in the U.S. federal jurisdiction and various state and non-U.S. jurisdictions. In the normal course of business, we are subject to examination by taxing authorities, including the U.S. and Canada. With limited exceptions, we have been audited for income tax purposes in the U.S. through 2021 and in Canada through 2016. In addition, several state income tax examinations are in progress for the years 2017 to 2021. \\n\\n12. Short-term Borrowings and Long-term Debt \\n\\nShort-term borrowings consist of the following: \\n\\n (Millions) 2023 2022 Commercial paper $ 178 \\xa0 $ 235 \\xa0 Notes — \\xa0 566 \\xa0 Finance leases 13 \\xa0 14 \\xa0 \\n\\nOther (1) \\n\\n— \\xa0 ( 1 ) Total short-term borrowings $ 191 \\xa0 $ 814 \\xa0 \\n\\n_______________________________________ \\n\\n(1) Includes unamortized net discount/premium on debt issuances and debt issuance costs. \\n\\nThe weighted-average interest rate of commercial paper, which consisted of U.S. borrowings, was 5.43 % as of July 30, 2023, and 2.63 % as of July 31, 2022. \\n\\nAs of July 30, 2023, we issued $ 29 million of standby letters of credit. On September 27, 2021, we entered into a committed revolving credit facility totaling $ 1.85 billion scheduled to mature on September 27, 2026 . This facility remained unused at July 30, 2023, except for $ 1 million of standby letters of credit that we issued under it. The facility contains customary covenants, including a financial covenant with respect to a minimum consolidated interest coverage ratio of consolidated adjusted EBITDA to consolidated interest expense (as each is defined in the credit facility) of not less than 3.25:1.00, measured quarterly, and customary events of default for credit facilities of this type . Loans under this facility will bear interest at the rates specified in the facility, which vary based on the type of loan and certain other customary conditions. The facility supports our commercial paper program and other general corporate purposes. \\n\\nOn April 4, 2023, we entered into an amendment to our existing revolving credit facility to replace remaining LIBOR-based benchmark rates applicable to borrowings under the revolving credit facility with SOFR-based benchmark rates, in advance of the cessation of LIBOR occurring on June 30, 2023. \\n\\nLong-term debt consists of the following:  (Millions) 2023 2022 \\n\\n3.65 % Notes due March 15, 2023 \\n\\n$ — \\xa0 $ 566 \\xa0 \\n\\n3.95 % Notes due March 15, 2025 \\n\\n850 \\xa0 850 \\xa0 \\n\\n3.30 % Notes due March 19, 2025 \\n\\n300 \\xa0 300 \\xa0 \\n\\nVariable-rate term loan due November 15, 2025 \\n\\n500 \\xa0 — \\xa0 \\n\\n4.15 % Notes due March 15, 2028 \\n\\n1,000 \\xa0 1,000 \\xa0 \\n\\n2.375 % Notes due April 24, 2030 \\n\\n500 \\xa0 500 \\xa0 \\n\\n3.80 % Notes due August 2, 2042 \\n\\n163 \\xa0 163 \\xa0 \\n\\n4.80 % Notes due March 15, 2048 \\n\\n700 \\xa0 700 \\xa0 \\n\\n3.125 % Notes due April 24, 2050 \\n\\n500 \\xa0 500 \\xa0 Finance leases 15 \\xa0 16 \\xa0 \\n\\nOther (1) \\n\\n( 30 ) ( 34 ) Total $ 4,498 \\xa0 $ 4,561 \\xa0 Less current portion — \\xa0 565 \\xa0 Total long-term debt $ 4,498 \\xa0 $ 3,996 \\xa0 \\n\\n_______________________________________ \\n\\n(1) Includes unamortized net discount/premium on debt issuances and debt issuance costs . \\n\\nPrincipal amounts of long-term debt mature as follows: \\n\\n (Millions) 2025 $ 1,158 \\xa0 2026 $ 507 \\xa0 2027 $ — \\xa0 2028 $ 1,000 \\xa0 Thereafter $ 1,863 \\xa0 \\n\\nDebt Extinguishments \\n\\nOn March 4, 2022, we completed the redemption of all $ 450 million outstanding aggregate principal amount of our 2.50 % Senior Notes due August 2, 2022 . The consideration for the redemption was $ 453 million, including $ 3 million of premium. We recognized a loss of $ 4 million (including the $ 3 million of premium and other costs), which was recorded in Interest expense in the Consolidated Statement of Earnings. In addition, we paid accrued and unpaid interest on the redeemed notes through the date of settlement. We used a combination of cash on hand and short-term debt to fund the redemption. \\n\\nDebt Repayments \\n\\nIn March 2023, we repaid our 3.65 % $ 566 million Notes. \\n\\nIn March 2021, we repaid our 3.30 % $ 321 million Notes and floating rate $ 400 million Notes, and in May 2021, we repaid our 8.875 % $ 200 million Notes. \\n\\nDebt Issuances \\n\\nOn November 15, 2022, we entered into a delayed draw term loan credit agreement (the DDTL Credit Agreement) totaling up to $ 500 million scheduled to mature on November 15, 2025. Loans under the DDTL Credit Agreement bear interest at the rates specified in the DDTL Credit Agreement, which vary based on the type of loan and certain other conditions. The DDTL Credit Agreement contains customary representations and warranties, affirmative and negative covenants, including a financial covenant with respect to a minimum consolidated interest coverage ratio of consolidated adjusted EBITDA to consolidated interest expense (as each is defined in the DDTL Credit Agreement) of not less than 3.25:1.00 , and events of default for credit facilities of this type. We borrowed $ 500 million under the DDTL Credit Agreement on March 13, 2023, and used the proceeds and cash on hand to repay the 3.65 % $ 566 million Notes that matured on March 15, 2023 . \\n\\n13. Financial Instruments \\n\\nThe principal market risks to which we are exposed are changes in foreign currency exchange rates, interest rates and commodity prices. In addition, we are exposed to equity price changes related to certain deferred compensation obligations. In order to manage these exposures, we follow established risk management policies and procedures, including the use of derivative contracts such as swaps, rate locks, options, forwards and commodity futures. We enter into these derivative contracts for periods consistent with the related underlying exposures, and the contracts do not constitute positions independent of those exposures. We do not enter into derivative contracts for speculative purposes and do not use leveraged instruments. Our derivative programs include instruments that qualify for hedge accounting treatment and instruments that are not designated as accounting hedges. \\n\\nConcentration of Credit Risk \\n\\nWe are exposed to the risk that counterparties to derivative contracts will fail to meet their contractual obligations. To mitigate counterparty credit risk, we enter into contracts only with carefully selected, leading, credit-worthy financial institutions, and distribute contracts among several financial institutions to reduce the concentration of credit risk. We did not have credit risk-related contingent features in our derivative instruments as of July 30, 2023, or July 31, 2022. \\n\\nWe are also exposed to credit risk from our customers. During 2023, our largest customer accounted for approximately 22 % of consolidated net sales. Our five largest customers accounted for approximately 47 % of our consolidated net sales in 2023. \\n\\nWe closely monitor credit risk associated with counterparties and customers. \\n\\nForeign Currency Exchange Risk \\n\\nWe are exposed to foreign currency exchange risk, primarily the Canadian dollar, related to intercompany transactions and third-party transactions. We utilize foreign exchange forward purchase and sale contracts to hedge these exposures. The contracts are either designated as cash-flow hedging instruments or are undesignated. We hedge portions of our forecasted foreign currency transaction exposure with foreign exchange forward contracts for periods typically up to 18 months. The notional amount of foreign exchange forward contracts accounted for as cash-flow hedges was $ 125 million as of \\n\\nJuly 30, 2023, and $ 140 million as of July 31, 2022. Changes in the fair value on the portion of the derivative included in the assessment of hedge effectiveness of cash-flow hedges are recorded in other comprehensive income (loss), until earnings are affected by the variability of cash flows. For derivatives that are designated and qualify as hedging instruments, the initial fair value of hedge components excluded from the assessment of effectiveness is recognized in earnings under a systematic and rational method over the life of the hedging instrument and is presented in the same statement of earnings line item as the earnings effect of the hedged item. Any difference between the change in the fair value of the hedge components excluded from the assessment of effectiveness and the amounts recognized in earnings is recorded as a component of other comprehensive income (loss). The notional amount of foreign exchange forward contracts that are not designated as accounting hedges was $ 15 million as of July 30, 2023, and $ 13 million as of July 31, 2022. \\n\\nInterest Rate Risk \\n\\nWe manage our exposure to changes in interest rates by optimizing the use of variable-rate and fixed-rate debt and by utilizing interest rate swaps in order to maintain our variable-to-total debt ratio within targeted guidelines. There were no interest rate swaps outstanding as of July 30, 2023, or July 31, 2022. \\n\\nCommodity Price Risk \\n\\nWe principally use a combination of purchase orders and various short- and long-term supply arrangements in connection with the purchase of raw materials, including certain commodities and agricultural products. We also enter into commodity futures, options and swap contracts to reduce the volatility of price fluctuations of wheat, diesel fuel, natural gas, soybean oil, aluminum, cocoa, corn, soybean meal and butter. Commodity futures, options and swap contracts are either designated as cash-flow hedging instruments or are undesignated. We hedge a portion of commodity requirements for periods typically up to 18 months. There were no commodity contracts designated as cash-flow hedges as of July 30, 2023. The notional amount of commodity contracts designated as cash-flow hedges was $ 3 million as of July 31, 2022. Changes in the fair value on the portion of the derivative included in the assessment of hedge effectiveness of cash-flow hedges are recorded in other comprehensive income (loss), until earnings are affected by the variability of cash flows. The notional amount of commodity contracts not designated as accounting hedges was $ 194 million as of July 30, 2023, and $ 254 million as of July 31, 2022. The change in fair value on undesignated instruments is recorded in Cost of products sold. \\n\\nWe have a supply contract under which prices for certain raw materials are established based on anticipated volume requirements over a twelve-month period. Certain prices under the contract are based in part on certain component parts of the raw materials that are in excess of our needs or not required for our operations, thereby creating an embedded derivative requiring bifurcation. We net settle amounts due under the contract with our counterparty. The notional amount was approximately $ 47 million as of July 30, 2023, and $ 39 million as of July 31, 2022. The change in fair value on the embedded derivative is recorded in Cost of products sold. \\n\\nDeferred Compensation Obligation Price Risk \\n\\nWe enter into swap contracts which hedge a portion of exposures relating to the total return of certain deferred compensation obligations. These contracts are not designated as hedges for accounting purposes. Unrealized gains (losses) and settlements are included in Administrative expenses in the Consolidated Statements of Earnings. We enter into these contracts for periods typically not exceeding 12 months. The notional amounts of the contracts as of July 30, 2023, and July 31, 2022, were $ 42 million and $ 50 million, respectively. \\n\\nThe following tables summarize the fair value of derivative instruments on a gross basis as recorded in the Consolidated Balance Sheets as of July 30, 2023, and July 31, 2022: \\n\\n (Millions) Balance Sheet Classification 2023 2022 Asset Derivatives Derivatives designated as hedges: Commodity contracts Other current assets $ — \\xa0 $ 3 \\xa0 Foreign exchange forward contracts Other current assets — \\xa0 2 \\xa0 Total derivatives designated as hedges $ — \\xa0 $ 5 \\xa0 Derivatives not designated as hedges: Commodity contracts Other current assets $ 15 \\xa0 $ 20 \\xa0 Deferred compensation contracts Other current assets 4 \\xa0 — \\xa0 Commodity contracts Other assets 1 \\xa0 — \\xa0 Total derivatives not designated as hedges $ 20 \\xa0 $ 20 \\xa0 Total asset derivatives $ 20 \\xa0 $ 25 \\xa0 \\n\\n (Millions) Balance Sheet Classification 2023 2022 Liability Derivatives Derivatives designated as hedges: Foreign exchange forward contracts Accrued liabilities $ 1 \\xa0 $ — \\xa0 Total derivatives designated as hedges $ 1 \\xa0 $ — \\xa0 Derivatives not designated as hedges: Commodity contracts Accrued liabilities $ 5 \\xa0 $ 30 \\xa0 Deferred compensation contracts Accrued liabilities — \\xa0 4 \\xa0 Total derivatives not designated as hedges $ 5 \\xa0 $ 34 \\xa0 Total liability derivatives $ 6 \\xa0 $ 34 \\xa0  \\n\\nWe do not offset the fair values of derivative assets and liabilities executed with the same counterparty that are generally subject to enforceable netting agreements. However, if we were to offset and record the asset and liability balances of derivatives on a net basis, the amounts presented in the Consolidated Balance Sheets as of July 30, 2023, and July 31, 2022, would be adjusted as detailed in the following table: \\n\\n 2023 2022 (Millions) Gross Amounts Presented in the Consolidated Balance Sheet Gross Amounts Not Offset in the Consolidated Balance Sheet Subject to Netting Agreements Net Amount Gross Amounts Presented in the Consolidated Balance Sheet Gross Amounts Not Offset in the Consolidated Balance Sheet Subject to Netting Agreements Net Amount Total asset derivatives $ 20 \\xa0 $ ( 5 ) $ 15 \\xa0 $ 25 \\xa0 $ ( 17 ) $ 8 \\xa0 Total liability derivatives $ 6 \\xa0 $ ( 5 ) $ 1 \\xa0 $ 34 \\xa0 $ ( 17 ) $ 17 \\xa0 \\n\\nWe are required to maintain cash margin accounts in connection with funding the settlement of open positions for exchange-traded commodity derivative instruments. A cash margin asset balance of $ 2 million at July 30, 2023, and $ 8 million at July 31, 2022, were included in Other current assets in the Consolidated Balance Sheets. \\n\\nThe following tables show the effect of our derivative instruments designated as cash-flow hedges for the years ended July 30, 2023, July 31, 2022, and August 1, 2021 in other comprehensive income (loss) (OCI) and the Consolidated Statements of Earnings: \\n\\n \\n\\n\\xa0 Total Cash-Flow Hedge OCI Activity (Millions) \\xa0 2023 2022 2021 OCI derivative gain (loss) at beginning of year $ — \\xa0 $ ( 5 ) $ ( 8 ) Effective portion of changes in fair value recognized in OCI: Commodity contracts — \\xa0 13 \\xa0 4 \\xa0 Foreign exchange forward contracts 5 \\xa0 4 \\xa0 ( 9 ) Amount of loss (gain) reclassified from OCI to earnings: Location in Earnings Commodity contracts Cost of products sold ( 3 ) ( 14 ) — \\xa0 Foreign exchange forward contracts Cost of products sold ( 8 ) 1 \\xa0 6 \\xa0 Foreign exchange forward contracts Other expenses / (income) — \\xa0 — \\xa0 1 \\xa0 Forward starting interest rate swaps Interest expense 1 \\xa0 1 \\xa0 1 \\xa0 OCI derivative gain (loss) at end of year $ ( 5 ) $ — \\xa0 $ ( 5 ) \\n\\nBased on current valuations, the amount expected to be reclassified from OCI into earnings within the next 12 months is a loss of $ 2 million. \\n\\nThe following table shows the total amounts of line items presented in the Consolidated Statements of Earnings for the years ended 2023, 2022, and 2021 in which the effects of derivative instruments designated as cash-flow hedges are recorded and the total effect of hedge activity on these line items are as follows: \\n\\n 2023 2022 2021 (Millions) Cost of products sold Interest expense Cost of products sold Interest expense Cost of products sold Other expenses / (income) Interest expense Consolidated Statements of Earnings: $ 6,440 \\xa0 $ 188 \\xa0 $ 5,935 \\xa0 $ 189 \\xa0 $ 5,665 \\xa0 $ ( 254 ) $ 210 \\xa0 Loss (gain) on cash-flow hedges: Amount of loss (gain) reclassified from OCI to earnings $ ( 11 ) $ 1 \\xa0 $ ( 13 ) $ 1 \\xa0 $ 6 \\xa0 $ 1 \\xa0 $ 1 \\xa0 \\n\\nThe amount excluded from effectiveness testing recognized in each line item of earnings using an amortization approach was not material in all periods presented. \\n\\nThe following table shows the effects of our derivative instruments not designated as hedges in the Consolidated Statements of Earnings: \\n\\n (Millions) Location of Loss (Gain) Recognized in Earnings 2023 2022 2021 Foreign exchange forward contracts Cost of products sold $ — \\xa0 $ — \\xa0 $ 2 \\xa0 Commodity contracts Cost of products sold ( 27 ) 8 \\xa0 ( 55 ) Deferred compensation contracts Administrative expenses ( 4 ) 3 \\xa0 ( 8 ) Total $ ( 31 ) $ 11 \\xa0 $ ( 61 ) \\n\\n14. Fair Value Measurements \\n\\nWe categorize financial assets and liabilities based on the following fair value hierarchy: \\n\\n• Level 1: Observable inputs that reflect quoted prices (unadjusted) for identical assets or liabilities in active markets. \\n\\n• Level 2: Inputs other than quoted prices included in Level 1 that are observable for the asset or liability through corroboration with observable market data. \\n\\n• Level 3: Unobservable inputs, which are valued based on our estimates of assumptions that market participants would use in pricing the asset or liability. \\n\\nFair value is defined as the exit price, or the amount that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between market participants as of the measurement date. When available, we use unadjusted quoted market prices to measure the fair value and classify such items as Level 1. If quoted market prices are not available, we base fair value upon internally developed models that use current market-based or independently sourced market parameters such as interest rates and currency rates. Included in the fair value of derivative instruments is an adjustment for credit and nonperformance risk. \\n\\nAssets and Liabilities Measured at Fair Value on a Recurring Basis \\n\\nThe following tables present our financial assets and liabilities that are measured at fair value on a recurring basis as of July 30, 2023, and July 31, 2022, consistent with the fair value hierarchy: \\n\\n \\xa0 Fair Value as of July 30, 2023 Fair Value Measurements at July 30, 2023 Using Fair Value Hierarchy Fair Value as of July 31, 2022 Fair Value Measurements at July 31, 2022 Using Fair Value Hierarchy (Millions) Level 1 Level 2 Level 3 Level 1 Level 2 Level 3 Assets Foreign exchange forward contracts (1) \\n\\n$ — \\xa0 $ — \\xa0 $ — \\xa0 $ — \\xa0 $ 2 \\xa0 $ — $ 2 \\xa0 $ — Commodity derivative contracts (2) \\n\\n16 \\xa0 11 \\xa0 3 \\xa0 2 \\xa0 23 \\xa0 — \\xa0 19 \\xa0 4 \\xa0 Deferred compensation derivative contracts (3) \\n\\n4 \\xa0 — \\xa0 4 \\xa0 — \\xa0 — \\xa0 — — \\xa0 — Deferred compensation investments (4) \\n\\n1 \\xa0 1 \\xa0 — \\xa0 — \\xa0 2 \\xa0 2 \\xa0 — — Total assets at fair value $ 21 \\xa0 $ 12 \\xa0 $ 7 \\xa0 $ 2 \\xa0 $ 27 \\xa0 $ 2 \\xa0 $ 21 \\xa0 $ 4 \\xa0 \\n\\n \\xa0 Fair Value as of July 30, 2023 Fair Value Measurements at July 30, 2023 Using Fair Value Hierarchy Fair Value as of July 31, 2022 Fair Value Measurements at July 31, 2022 Using Fair Value Hierarchy (Millions) Level 1 Level 2 Level 3 Level 1 Level 2 Level 3 Liabilities Foreign exchange forward contracts (1) \\n\\n$ 1 \\xa0 $ — \\xa0 $ 1 \\xa0 $ — \\xa0 $ — \\xa0 $ — $ — \\xa0 $ — Commodity derivative contracts (2) \\n\\n5 \\xa0 3 \\xa0 2 \\xa0 — \\xa0 30 \\xa0 6 \\xa0 24 \\xa0 — Deferred compensation derivative contracts (3) \\n\\n— \\xa0 — \\xa0 — \\xa0 — \\xa0 4 \\xa0 — 4 \\xa0 — Deferred compensation obligation (4) \\n\\n91 \\xa0 91 \\xa0 — \\xa0 — \\xa0 96 \\xa0 96 \\xa0 — — Total liabilities at fair value $ 97 \\xa0 $ 94 \\xa0 $ 3 \\xa0 $ — \\xa0 $ 130 \\xa0 $ 102 \\xa0 $ 28 \\xa0 $ — \\n\\n___________________________________ \\xa0 \\n\\n(1) Based on observable market transactions of spot currency rates and forward rates. \\n\\n(2) Level 1 and 2 are based on quoted futures exchanges and on observable prices of futures and options transactions in the marketplace. Level 3 is based on unobservable inputs in which there is little or no market data, which requires management’s own assumptions within an internally developed model. \\n\\n(3) Based on equity index swap rates. \\n\\n(4) Based on the fair value of the participants’ investments. \\n\\nThe following table summarizes the changes in fair value of Level 3 assets for the years ended July 30, 2023, and July 31, 2022:  (Millions) 2023 2022 Fair value at beginning of year $ 4 \\xa0 $ 1 \\xa0 Gains (losses) 3 \\xa0 18 \\xa0 Settlements ( 5 ) ( 15 ) Fair value at end of year $ 2 \\xa0 $ 4 \\xa0  \\n\\nFair Value of Financial Instruments \\n\\nThe carrying values of cash and cash equivalents, accounts receivable and accounts payable approximate fair value. \\n\\nThere were no cash equivalents at July 30, 2023, and $ 27 million at July 31, 2022. Cash equivalents represent fair value as these highly liquid investments have an original maturity of three months or less. Fair value of cash equivalents is based on Level 2 inputs. \\n\\nThe fair value of short- and long-term debt was $ 4.293 billion at July 30, 2023, and $ 4.637 billion at July 31, 2022. The carrying value was $ 4.689 billion at July 30, 2023, and $ 4.81 billion at July 31, 2022. The fair value of long-term debt is principally estimated using Level 2 inputs based on quoted market prices or pricing models using current market rates. \\n\\n15. Shareholders' Equity \\n\\nWe have authorized 560 million shares of Capital stock with $ .0375 par value and 40 million shares of Preferred stock, issuable in one or more classes, with or without par as may be authorized by the Board of Directors. No Preferred stock has been issued. \\n\\nShare Repurchase Programs \\n\\nIn June 2021, the Board authorized an anti-dilutive share repurchase program of up to $ 250 million (June 2021 program) to offset the impact of dilution from shares issued under our stock compensation programs. The June 2021 program has no expiration date, but it may be suspended or discontinued at any time. Repurchases under the June 2021 program may be made in open-market or privately negotiated transactions. \\n\\nIn September 2021, the Board approved a strategic share repurchase program of up to $ 500 million (September 2021 program). The September 2021 program has no expiration date, but it may be suspended or discontinued at any time. Repurchases under the September 2021 program may be made in open-market or privately negotiated transactions. \\n\\nIn 2023, we repurchased 2.698 million shares at a cost of $ 142 million. Of this amount, $ 68 million was used to repurchase shares pursuant to our June 2021 program and $ 74 million was used to repurchase share pursuant to our September 2021 program. As of July 30, 2023, approximately $ 104 million remained available under the June 2021 program and approximately $ 301 million remained under the September 2021 program. In 2022, we repurchased 3.8 million shares at a cost of $ 167 million. In 2021, we repurchased approximately 1 million shares at a cost of $ 36 million. \\n\\n16. Stock-based Compensation \\n\\nIn 2005, shareholders approved the 2005 Long-Term Incentive Plan, which authorized the issuance of 6 million shares to satisfy awards of stock options, stock appreciation rights, unrestricted stock, restricted stock/units (including performance restricted stock) and performance units. In 2008, shareholders approved an amendment to the 2005 Long-Term Incentive Plan to increase the number of authorized shares to 10.5 million and in 2010, shareholders approved another amendment to the 2005 Long-Term Incentive Plan to increase the number of authorized shares to 17.5 million. In 2015, shareholders approved the 2015 Long-Term Incentive Plan, which authorized the issuance of 13 million shares. Approximately 6 million of these shares were shares that were currently available under the 2005 plan and were incorporated into the 2015 Plan upon approval by shareholders. In 2022, shareholders approved the 2022 Long-Term Incentive Plan, which authorized the issuance of 12 million shares to satisfy awards of stock options, stock appreciation rights, unrestricted stock, restricted stock/units (including performance restricted stock) and performance units. The 2022 Long-Term Incentive Plan replaced the 2015 Long-Term Incentive Plan and no new awards can be granted under the 2015 Long-Term Incentive Plan and none of the shares that remain available under the 2015 Long-Term Incentive Plan are available for issuance under the 2022 Long-Term Incentive Plan. \\n\\nAwards under Long-Term Incentive Plans may be granted to employees and directors. Pursuant to the Long-Term Incentive Plan, we adopted a long-term incentive compensation program which provides for grants of total shareholder return (TSR) performance restricted stock/units, EPS performance restricted stock/units, strategic performance restricted stock/units, time-lapse restricted stock/units, special performance restricted stock/units, free cash flow (FCF) performance restricted stock/units and unrestricted stock. Under the program, awards of TSR performance restricted stock/units will be earned by comparing our total shareholder return during a three-year period to the respective total shareholder returns of companies in a performance peer group. Based upon our ranking in the performance peer group after the relevant three-year performance period, a recipient \\n\\nof TSR performance restricted stock/units may earn a total award ranging from 0 % to 200 % of the initial grant. Awards of EPS performance restricted stock/units granted beginning in 2022 will be earned upon the achievement of our adjusted EPS compound annual growth rate goal (EPS CAGR performance restricted stock/units), measured over a three-year period. A recipient of EPS CAGR performance restricted stock/units may earn a total award ranging from 0 % to 200 % of the initial grant. Awards of EPS performance restricted stock/units granted prior to 2022 were earned based upon our achievement of annual earnings per share goals and vested over the relevant three-year period. During the three-year vesting period, a recipient of EPS performance restricted stock/units earned a total award of either 0 % or 100 % of the initial grant. Awards of the strategic performance restricted stock units were earned based upon the achievement of two key metrics, net sales and EPS growth, compared to strategic plan objectives during a three-year period. A recipient of strategic performance restricted stock units earned a total award ranging from 0 % to 200 % of the initial grant. Awards of FCF performance restricted stock units were earned based upon the achievement of free cash flow (defined as Net cash provided by operating activities less capital expenditures and certain investing and financing activities) compared to annual operating plan objectives over a three-year period. An annual objective was established each fiscal year for three consecutive years. Performance against these objectives was averaged at the end of the three-year period to determine the number of underlying units that vested at the end of the three years. A recipient of FCF performance restricted stock units earned a total award ranging from 0 % to 200 % of the initial grant. Awards of time-lapse restricted stock/units will vest ratably over the three-year period. In addition, we may issue special grants of restricted stock/units to attract and retain executives which vest over various periods. Awards are generally granted annually in October. \\n\\nStock options are granted on a selective basis under the Long-Term Incentive Plans. The term of a stock option granted under these plans may not exceed ten years from the date of grant. The option price may not be less than the fair market value of a share of common stock on the date of the grant. Options granted under these plans generally vest ratably over a three-year period. In 2019, we also granted certain options that vest at the end of a three-year period. We last issued stock options in 2019. \\n\\nIn 2023, we issued time-lapse restricted stock units, unrestricted stock, TSR performance restricted stock units and EPS CAGR performance restricted stock units. We last issued FCF performance restricted stock units in 2019, EPS performance restricted stock units in 2018, strategic performance restricted stock units in 2014 and special performance restricted units in 2015. \\n\\nIn determining stock-based compensation expense, we estimate forfeitures expected to occur. Total pre-tax stock-based compensation expense and tax-related benefits recognized in the Consolidated Statements of Earnings were as follows: \\n\\n (Millions) 2023 2022 2021 Total pre-tax stock-based compensation expense $ 63 \\xa0 $ 59 \\xa0 $ 64 \\xa0 Tax-related benefits $ 12 \\xa0 $ 10 \\xa0 $ 12 \\xa0  \\n\\nThe following table summarizes stock option activity as of July 30, 2023: \\n\\n Options Weighted- Average Exercise Price Weighted- Average Remaining Contractual Life Aggregate Intrinsic Value (In thousands) \\xa0 (In years) (Millions) \\n\\nOutstanding at July 31, 2022 \\n\\n1,297 \\xa0 $ 46.04 \\xa0 Granted — \\xa0 $ — \\xa0 Exercised ( 464 ) $ 48.33 \\xa0 Terminated — \\xa0 $ — \\xa0 \\n\\nOutstanding at July 30, 2023 \\n\\n833 \\xa0 $ 44.77 \\xa0 4.2 $ 4 \\xa0 \\n\\nExercisable at July 30, 2023 \\n\\n833 \\xa0 $ 44.77 \\xa0 4.2 $ 4 \\xa0 \\n\\nThe total intrinsic value of options exercised during 2023 and 2022 was $ 3 million and $ 1 million, respectively. The total intrinsic value of options exercised during 2021 was not material. We measured the fair value of stock options using the Black-Scholes option pricing model. \\n\\nWe expensed stock options on a straight-line basis over the vesting period, except for awards issued to retirement eligible participants, which we expensed on an accelerated basis. As of January 2022, compensation related to stock options was fully expensed. \\n\\nThe following table summarizes time-lapse restricted stock units and EPS CAGR performance restricted stock units as of July 30, 2023: \\n\\n Units Weighted- Average Grant-Date Fair Value \\xa0 (In thousands) \\xa0 \\n\\nNonvested at July 31, 2022 \\n\\n1,946 \\xa0 $ 43.88 \\xa0 Granted 1,227 \\xa0 $ 47.65 \\xa0 Vested ( 770 ) $ 45.25 \\xa0 Forfeited ( 129 ) $ 44.94 \\xa0 \\n\\nNonvested at July 30, 2023 \\n\\n2,274 \\xa0 $ 45.39 \\xa0 \\n\\nWe determine the fair value of time-lapse restricted stock units, EPS CAGR performance restricted stock units, FCF performance restricted stock units and EPS performance restricted stock units based on the quoted price of our stock at the date of grant. We expense time-lapse restricted stock units and EPS CAGR performance restricted stock units on a straight-line basis over the vesting period, except for awards issued to retirement-eligible participants, which we expense on an accelerated basis. There were 560 thousand EPS CAGR performance target grants outstanding at July 30, 2023, with a weighted-average grant-date fair value of $ 44.33 . We expensed FCF performance restricted stock units over the requisite service period of each objective. As of October 31, 2021, there were no FCF performance target grants outstanding. We expensed EPS performance restricted stock units on a graded vesting basis, expect for awards issued to retirement-eligible participants, which we expensed on an accelerated basis. As of November 1, 2020, there were no EPS performance target grants outstanding. The actual number of EPS CAGR performance restricted stock units, FCF performance restricted stock units and EPS performance restricted stock units, that vest will depend on actual performance achieved. We estimate expense based on the number of awards expected to vest. \\n\\nAs of July 30, 2023, total remaining unearned compensation related to nonvested time-lapse restricted stock units and EPS CAGR performance restricted units was $ 43 million, which will be amortized over the weighted-average remaining service period of 1.6 years. In the first quarter of 2022, recipients of FCF performance restricted stock units earned 167 % of the initial grants based upon the average of actual performance achieved during a three-year period ended August 1, 2021. As a result, approximately 158 thousand additional shares were awarded. The fair value of restricted stock units vested during 2023, 2022 and 2021 was $ 37 million, $ 50 million and $ 38 million, respectively. The weighted-average grant-date fair value of the restricted stock units granted during 2022 and 2021 was $ 41.96 and $ 48.37 , respectively. \\n\\nThe following table summarizes TSR performance restricted stock units as of July 30, 2023: \\n\\n Units Weighted- Average Grant-Date Fair Value \\xa0 (In thousands) \\xa0 \\n\\nNonvested at July 31, 2022 \\n\\n1,153 \\xa0 $ 55.63 \\xa0 Granted 296 \\xa0 $ 53.74 \\xa0 Vested ( 443 ) $ 63.06 \\xa0 Forfeited ( 58 ) $ 51.70 \\xa0 \\n\\nNonvested at July 30, 2023 \\n\\n948 \\xa0 $ 51.81 \\xa0 \\n\\nWe estimated the fair value of TSR performance restricted stock units at the grant date using a Monte Carlo simulation.

As of July 30, 2023, total remaining unearned compensation related to TSR performance restricted stock units was $ 13 million, which will be amortized over the weighted-average \\n\\nremaining service period of 1.6 years. In the first quarter of 2023, recipients of TSR performance restricted stock units earned 100 % of the initial grants based upon our TSR ranking in a performance peer group during a three-year period ended July 29, 2022. In the first quarter of 2022, recipients of TSR performance restricted stock units earned 75 % of the initial grants based upon our TSR ranking in a performance peer group during a three-year period ended July 30, 2021. In the first quarter of 2021, recipients of TSR performance restricted stock units earned 50 % of the initial grants based upon our TSR ranking in a performance peer group during a three-year period ended July 31, 2020. The fair value of TSR performance restricted stock units vested during 2023, 2022, and 2021 was $ 21 million, $ 8 million and $ 11 million, respectively. The weighted-average grant-date fair value of the TSR performance restricted stock units granted during 2022 and 2021 was $ 45.54 and $ 54.93 , respectively. In the first quarter of 2024, recipients of TSR performance restricted stock units will receive a 75 % payout based upon our TSR ranking in a performance peer group during a three-year period ended July 28, 2023. \\n\\nThe tax benefits on the exercise of stock options in 2023, 2022 and 2021 were not material. Cash received from the exercise of stock options was $ 22 million, $ 3 million and $ 2 million for 2023, 2022, and 2021, respectively, and is reflected in cash flows from financing activities in the Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows. \\n\\n17. Commitments and Contingencies \\n\\nRegulatory and Litigation Matters \\n\\nWe are involved in various pending or threatened legal or regulatory proceedings, including purported class actions, arising from the conduct of business both in the ordinary course and otherwise. Modern pleading practice in the U.S. permits considerable variation in the assertion of monetary damages or other relief. Jurisdictions may permit claimants not to specify the monetary damages sought or may permit claimants to state only that the amount sought is sufficient to invoke the jurisdiction of the trial court. In addition, jurisdictions may permit plaintiffs to allege monetary damages in amounts well exceeding reasonably possible verdicts in the jurisdiction for similar matters. This variability in pleadings, together with our actual experiences in litigating or resolving through settlement numerous claims over an extended period of time, demonstrates to us that the monetary relief which may be specified in a lawsuit or claim bears little relevance to its merits or disposition value. \\n\\nDue to the unpredictable nature of litigation, the outcome of a litigation matter and the amount or range of potential loss at particular points in time is normally difficult to ascertain. Uncertainties can include how fact finders will evaluate documentary evidence and the credibility and effectiveness of witness testimony, and how trial and appellate courts will apply the law in the context of the pleadings or evidence presented, whether by motion practice, or at trial or on appeal. Disposition valuations are also subject to the uncertainty of how opposing parties and their counsel will themselves view the relevant evidence and applicable law. \\n\\nWe establish liabilities for litigation and regulatory loss contingencies when information related to the loss contingencies shows both that it is probable that a loss has been incurred and the amount of the loss can be reasonably estimated. It is possible that some matters could require us to pay damages or make other expenditures or establish accruals in amounts that could not be reasonably estimated as of July 30, 2023. While the potential future charges could be material in a particular quarter or annual period, based on information currently known by us, we do not believe any such charges are likely to have a material adverse effect on our consolidated results of operations or financial condition. \\n\\nOther Contingencies \\n\\nWe guarantee approximately 4,700 bank loans made to independent contractor distributors by third-party financial institutions for the purchase of distribution routes. The maximum potential amount of the future payments under existing guarantees we could be required to make is $ 496 million as of July 30, 2023. Our guarantees are indirectly secured by the distribution routes. We do not expect that we will be required to make material guarantee payments as a result of defaults on the bank loans guaranteed. The amounts recognized as of July 30, 2023, and July 31, 2022, were not material. \\n\\nWe have provided certain indemnifications in connection with divestitures, contracts and other transactions. Certain indemnifications have finite expiration dates. Liabilities recognized based on known exposures related to such matters were not material at July 30, 2023, and July 31, 2022. \\n\\n18.

There are also several pending lawsuits filed by purported shareholders of Sovos Brands seeking, among other things, to enjoin the acquisition. If any condition to the acquisition is not satisfied or waived, the completion of the acquisition could be significantly delayed or not occur at all. \", \"Management’s Report on Internal Control Over Financial Reporting \\n\\nThe management of Campbell Soup Company (the Company) is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting (as such term is defined in Rule 13a-15(e) under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended). Internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles in the United States of America. \\n\\nThe Company's internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that: \\n\\n• pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the Company; \\n\\n• provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the Company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and Directors of the Company; and \", \"• provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the Company's assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements. \", 'Because of its inherent limitations, any system of internal control over financial reporting, no matter how well defined, may not prevent or detect misstatements. Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate. \\n\\nThe Company’s management assessed the effectiveness of the Company’s internal control over financial reporting as of July 30, 2023. In making this assessment, management used the criteria set forth by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (COSO) in Internal Control — Integrated Framework (2013) . Based on this assessment using those criteria, management concluded that the Company’s internal control over financial reporting was effective as of July 30, 2023. \\n\\nThe effectiveness of the Company’s internal control over financial reporting as of July 30, 2023 has been audited by PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP, an independent registered public accounting firm, as stated in their report, which appears on the next page. \\n\\n /s/ Mark A.

We also have audited the Company\\'s internal control over financial reporting as of July 30, 2023, based on criteria established in Internal Control - Integrated Framework (2013) issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (COSO). \\n\\nIn our opinion, the consolidated financial statements referred to above present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of the Company as of July 30, 2023 and July 31, 2022, and the results of its operations and its cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended July 30, 2023 in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America. Also in our opinion, the Company maintained, in all material respects, effective internal control over financial reporting as of July 30, 2023, based on criteria established in Internal Control - Integrated Framework (2013) issued by the COSO. \\n\\nBasis for Opinions \\n\\nThe Company\\'s management is responsible for these consolidated financial statements, for maintaining effective internal control over financial reporting, and for its assessment of the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting, included in the accompanying Management\\'s Report on Internal Control Over Financial Reporting. Our responsibility is to express opinions on the Company’s consolidated financial statements and on the Company\\'s internal control over financial reporting based on our audits. We are a public accounting firm registered with the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States) (PCAOB) and are required to be independent with respect to the Company in accordance with the U.S. federal securities laws and the applicable rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB. \\n\\nWe conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audits to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the consolidated financial statements are free of material misstatement, whether due to error or fraud, and whether effective internal control over financial reporting was maintained in all material respects. \\n\\nOur audits of the consolidated financial statements included performing procedures to assess the risks of material misstatement of the consolidated financial statements, whether due to error or fraud, and performing procedures that respond to those risks. Such procedures included examining, on a test basis, evidence regarding the amounts and disclosures in the consolidated financial statements. Our audits also included evaluating the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall presentation of the consolidated financial statements. Our audit of internal control over financial reporting included obtaining an understanding of internal control over financial reporting, assessing the risk that a material weakness exists, and testing and evaluating the design and operating effectiveness of internal control based on the assessed risk. Our audits also included performing such other procedures as we considered necessary in the circumstances. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinions. \\n\\nDefinition and Limitations of Internal Control over Financial Reporting ', 'A company’s internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. A company’s internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that (i) pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company; (ii) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the company; and (iii) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the company’s assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements. ', \"Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate. \\n\\nCritical Audit Matters \\n\\nThe critical audit matter communicated below is a matter arising from the current period audit of the consolidated financial statements that was communicated or required to be communicated to the audit committee and that (i) relates to accounts or disclosures that are material to the consolidated financial statements and (ii) involved our especially challenging, subjective, or complex judgments. The communication of critical audit matters does not alter in any way our opinion on the consolidated financial statements, taken as a whole, and we are not, by communicating the critical audit matter below, providing a separate opinion on the critical audit matter or on the accounts or disclosures to which it relates. \\n\\nIndefinite-Lived Intangible Assets Impairment Test for Certain Trademarks \\n\\nAs described in Notes 1 and 5 to the consolidated financial statements, the Company’s indefinite-lived intangible assets (trademarks) were $2.541 billion as of July 30, 2023. Of the carrying value of all indefinite-lived trademarks, $620 million related to the Snyder's of Hanover trademark, $350 million related to the Lance trademark, $318 million related to the Kettle Brand trademark, $280 million related to the Pacific Foods trademark, and $187 million related to the Cape Cod trademark. Management conducts a test at least annually in the fourth quarter for impairment, or more often if events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of the asset may be impaired. Indefinite-lived intangible assets are tested for impairment by comparing the fair value of the asset to the carrying value. Fair value is determined using a relief from royalty valuation method based on discounted cash flow analyses that include significant management assumptions such as revenue growth rates, weighted average costs of capital and assumed royalty rates. If the carrying value exceeds fair value, an impairment charge will be recorded to reduce the asset to fair value. \\n\\nThe principal considerations for our determination that performing procedures relating to the indefinite-lived intangible assets impairment test for certain trademarks is a critical audit matter are (i) the significant judgment by management when developing the fair value estimate of certain trademarks, (ii) a high degree of auditor judgment, subjectivity, and effort in performing procedures and evaluating management’s significant assumptions related to the weighted average costs of capital and assumed royalty rates for the Snyder's of Hanover, Lance, Kettle Brand, Pacific Foods, and Cape Cod trademarks, and (iii) the audit effort involved the use of professionals with specialized skill and knowledge. \\n\\nAddressing the matter involved performing procedures and evaluating audit evidence in connection with forming our overall opinion on the consolidated financial statements. These procedures included testing the effectiveness of controls relating to management’s indefinite-lived intangible assets impairment test for trademarks. These procedures also included, among others (i) testing management’s process for developing the fair value estimate of certain trademarks, (ii) evaluating the appropriateness of the relief from royalty valuation method, (iii) testing the completeness and accuracy of underlying data used in the relief from royalty valuation method, and (iv) evaluating the reasonableness of the significant assumptions used by management related to the weighted average costs of capital and assumed royalty rates for the Snyder's of Hanover, Lance, Kettle Brand, Pacific Foods, and Cape Cod trademarks. Evaluating management’s assumption related to the assumed royalty rates involved evaluating whether the assumption used by management was reasonable considering (i) the current and past profitability of certain trademarks, (ii) the consistency with external market and industry data, and (iii) whether the assumption was consistent with evidence obtained in other areas of the audit. Professionals with specialized skill and knowledge were used to assist in the evaluation of the appropriateness of the relief from royalty valuation method and the reasonableness of the weighted average cost of capital and assumed royalty rate assumptions. \\n\\n /s/ PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP Philadelphia, Pennsylvania September 21, 2023 \\n\\nWe have served as the Company’s auditor since 1954. \\n\\n\"]\n"

If any of these risks actually occur, our business, results of operations, cash flows and financial condition could be materially and adversely impacted, which might cause the value of our securities to decline. \\n\\nBusiness and Industry Risks \\n\\nWe face risks associated with significant international operations, including exposure to foreign currency fluctuations. \\n\\nWe operate on a global basis serving consumers in more than 200 countries and territories with approximately two-thirds of our Net sales originating in markets outside the U.S. While geographic diversity helps to reduce our exposure to risks in any one country or part of the world, it also means that we face risks associated with significant international operations, including, but not limited to: \\n\\n&#8226; changing macroeconomic conditions in our markets, including as a result of inflation, the war in Ukraine, volatile commodity prices and increases in the cost of raw and packaging materials, labor, energy and logistics; \\n\\n&#8226; political or economic instability, geopolitical events, wars and military conflicts, such as the war in Ukraine, environmental events, widespread health emergencies, such as COVID-19 or other pandemics or epidemics, natural disasters or social or labor unrest; \\n\\n&#8226; changes in exchange rates for foreign currencies, which may reduce the U.S. dollar value of revenues, profits and cash flows from non-U.S. markets or increase our supply costs, as measured in U.S. dollars, in those markets; \\n\\n&#8226; exchange controls and other limits on our ability to import or export raw materials or finished product, including as a result of COVID-19, and the war in Ukraine, or to repatriate earnings from overseas; \\n\\n&#8226; lack of well-established, reliable and/or impartial legal systems in certain countries where we operate and difficulties in enforcing contractual, intellectual property or other legal rights; \\n\\n&#8226; foreign ownership and investment restrictions and the potential for nationalization or expropriation of property or other resources; and \\n\\n&#8226; changes to trade policies and agreements and other foreign or domestic legal and regulatory requirements, including those resulting in potentially adverse tax consequences or the imposition of and/or the increase in trade restrictions and/or tariffs, sanctions, price controls, labor laws, travel or immigration restrictions (including as a result of pandemics, epidemics or other widespread health emergencies, such as the COVID-19 pandemic), profit controls or other government controls, including as a result of the war in Ukraine. \\n\\nAny or all of the foregoing risks could have a significant impact on our ability to sell our products on a competitive basis in international markets and may adversely affect our business, results of operations, cash flows and financial condition. In addition, a number of these risks may adversely impact consumer confidence and consumption, which could reduce sales volumes of our products or result in a shift in our product mix from higher margin to lower margin product offerings. \\n\\nWe face risks resulting from political and macroeconomic instability and geopolitical events, such as the ongoing war in Ukraine and the related geopolitical tensions. We suspended the importation and sales of all products in Russia other than essential health and hygiene products for everyday use and ceased all capital investments and media activities in Russia. While these actions have impacted our Eurasia business, they have not had a material impact on our business, results of operations, cash flow or financial condition. In 2022, our Eurasia business constituted approximately 2% of our consolidated net sales and approximately 3% of our consolidated operating profit (the majority of which was Russia). We, \\n\\nhowever, have experienced, and expect to continue to experience, risks related to the impact of the war in Ukraine, including increases in the cost and, in certain cases, limitations on the availability of raw and packaging materials and commodities (including oil and natural gas), supply chain and logistics challenges and foreign currency volatility. We also continue to monitor the impact of the sanctions and export controls imposed in the response to the war in Ukraine. The situation continues to evolve and significant uncertainties regarding the full impact of the war in Ukraine or the related impacts on the global economy and geopolitical relations, in general and on our business in particular, remain and may be impacted by any or all of the foregoing risks. The war in Ukraine may also heighten other risks disclosed in this Annual Report on Form 10-K, any of which could have an adverse impact on our business, results of operations, cash flows or financial condition. \\n\\nFurthermore, the imposition of tariffs and/or increase in tariffs on various products by the United States and other countries have introduced greater uncertainty with respect to trade policies and government regulations affecting trade between the United States and other countries and new and/or increased tariffs have subjected, and may continue in the future to subject, us to additional costs and expenditure of resources. Major developments in trade relations, including the imposition of new or increased tariffs by the United States and/or other countries, such as China, and any emerging nationalist trends in specific countries could alter the trade environment and consumer purchasing behavior which, in turn, could have a material effect on our business, results of operations, cash flows and financial condition. \\n\\nIn an effort to minimize the impact on earnings of foreign currency rate movements, we engage in a combination of selling price increases, where permitted, sourcing strategies, cost-containment measures and selective hedging of foreign currency transactions. However, the impact of these measures have not and may not in the future fully offset any negative impact of foreign currency rate movements on our business, results of operations, cash flows and financial condition. \\n\\nSignificant competition in our industry could adversely affect our business. \\n\\nWe face vigorous competition worldwide, including from strong local competitors and from other large, multinational companies, some of which have greater resources than we do. In addition, the substantial growth in eCommerce has encouraged the entry of new competitors and business models. \\n\\nWe face competition in several aspects of our business, including pricing, promotional activities, new product introductions and expansion into new geographies and channels. Some of our competitors may spend more aggressively on or have more effective advertising and promotional activities than we do, introduce competing products more quickly and/or respond more effectively to business and economic conditions and changing consumer preferences, including by launching innovative new products. Such competition also extends to administrative and legal challenges of product claims and advertising. Our success is increasingly dependent on our ability to effectively leverage digital technology and data analytics to gain new commercial insights and develop relevant marketing and advertising to reach customers and consumers. Our ability to compete also depends on the strength of our brands and on our ability to enforce and defend our intellectual property, including patent, trademark, copyright, trade secret and trade dress rights, against infringement and legal challenges by competitors. \\n\\nWe may be unable to anticipate the timing and scale of such initiatives or challenges by competitors or to successfully respond to them, which could harm our business. In addition, the cost of responding to such initiatives and challenges, including management time, out-of-pocket expenses and price reductions, may affect our performance. A failure to compete effectively could adversely affect our business, results of operations, cash flows and financial condition. \\n\\nIncreasing dependence on key retailers in developed markets, changes in the policies of our retail trade customers, the emergence of alternative retail channels and the rapidly changing retail landscape and changing consumer preferences may adversely affect our business. \\n\\nOur products are sold in a highly competitive global marketplace which has experienced increased trade concentration and the growing presence of large-format retailers, discounters and eCommerce retailers. With the growing trend toward retail trade consolidation, the substantial growth of eCommerce and the integration of traditional and digital operations at key retailers, we are increasingly dependent on certain retailers, and some of these retailers have and may continue to have greater bargaining strength than we do. They have used and may continue to use this leverage to demand higher trade discounts, allowances, slotting fees or increased investment, including through display media, paid search, preparation fees and co-op programs, which have led to and could continue to lead to reduced sales or profitability in certain markets. The loss of a key customer or a significant reduction in sales to a key customer could adversely affect our business, results of \\n\\noperations, cash flows and financial condition. For additional information regarding our customers, see &#8220;Distribution; Raw Materials; Competition; Trademarks and Patents&#8221; in Item 1 &#8220;Business.&#8221; \\n\\nWe also have been and may continue to be negatively affected by changes in the policies or practices of our retail trade customers, such as inventory destocking, fulfillment requirements, limitations on access to shelf space, delisting of our products, or sustainability, supply chain or packaging standards or initiatives. For example, a determination by a key retailer that any of our ingredients should not be used in certain consumer products or that our packaging does not comply with certain requirements and standards could adversely impact our business, results of operations, cash flows and financial condition. In addition, &#8220;private label&#8221; products sold by our retail customers, which are typically sold at lower prices than branded products, are a source of competition for certain of our products. \\n\\nFurther, the retail landscape in many of our markets continues to evolve as a result of the substantial growth of eCommerce, changing consumer behaviors and preferences (as consumers increasingly shop online and via mobile and social applications) and the increased presence of alternative retail channels, such as subscription services and direct-to-customer businesses. The substantial growth in eCommerce and the emergence of alternative retail channels have created and may continue to create pricing pressures and/or adversely affect our relationships with our key retailers. \\n\\nFurther, consumer preferences continue to evolve due to a number of factors, including evolving consumer concerns or perceptions (whether or not valid) regarding environmental, social and governance (&#8220;ESG&#8221;) practices, including the sourcing and sustainability of packaging materials, a growing demand for natural or organic products and ingredients and ingredient transparency, evolving consumer concerns or perceptions regarding the effects of ingredients, changing consumer sentiment toward non-local products or sources and changing perceptions of and increased focus on labor and human rights and environmental impacts (including responsible sourcing, deforestation, packaging, plastic, energy and water use and waste management). \\n\\nIf we are not successful in continuing to adapt or to effectively react to changes in consumer behaviors, preferences or purchasing patterns and/or changing market dynamics, including customer policies or the proliferation of eCommerce and alternative retail channels, our business, results of operations, cash flows and financial condition could be adversely affected. \\n\\nThe growth of our business depends on the successful identification, development and launch of innovative new products. \\n\\nOur growth depends on the continued success of existing products, the successful identification, development and launch of innovative new and differentiated products and the expansion into adjacent categories, channels of distribution or geographies. Our ability to launch new products, to sustain existing products and to expand into adjacent categories, channels of distribution or geographies is affected by whether we can successfully: \\n\\n&#8226; identify, develop and fund technological innovations; \\n\\n&#8226; obtain and maintain necessary intellectual property protection and avoid infringing intellectual property rights of others; \\n\\n&#8226; obtain approvals and registrations of regulated products, including from the FDA and other regulatory bodies in the U.S. and abroad; and \\n\\n&#8226; anticipate and quickly respond to the needs and preferences of consumers and customers. \\n\\nThe identification, development and introduction of innovative new products that drive incremental sales involves considerable costs and effort, and any new product may not generate sufficient customer and consumer interest and sales to become a profitable product or to cover the costs of its development and promotion. Our ability to achieve a successful launch of a new product could also be adversely affected by preemptive actions taken by competitors in response to the launch, such as increased promotional activities and advertising. In addition, new products may not be accepted quickly or significantly in the marketplace. \\n\\nOur ability to quickly innovate to adapt and market our products and to adapt our packaging and the sustainability profile of our products to meet evolving consumer preferences is an essential part of our business strategy. The failure to \\n\\ndevelop and launch successful new products or to adapt our packaging, the sustainability profile of our products or supply chain to meet such preferences could hinder the growth of our business and any delay in the development or launch of a new product could result in us not being the first to market, which could compromise our competitive position and adversely affect our business, results of operations, cash flows and financial condition. In addition, our success in launching new products is also dependent on our ability to deliver effective and efficient marketing in an evolving media landscape (including digital), which is subject to dynamic and increasingly restrictive privacy requirements. \\n\\nIf, in the course of identifying or developing new products, we are found to have infringed the trademark, trade secret, copyright, patent or other intellectual property rights of others, directly or indirectly, through the use of third-party ideas or technologies, such a finding could adversely affect our ability to develop innovative new products and adversely affect our business, results of operations, cash flows and financial condition. Even if we are not found to infringe a third party&#8217;s intellectual property rights, claims of infringement could adversely affect us, including by increasing costs and by delaying the launch of new products. \\n\\nWe face various risks related to pandemics, epidemics or similar widespread public health concerns, which may have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations, cash flows and financial condition. \\n\\nWe face various risks related to pandemics, epidemics or similar widespread public health concerns, including the COVID-19 pandemic. A pandemic, epidemic or similar widespread health concern could have, and COVID-19 has had and may continue to have, a variety of impacts on our business, results of operations, cash flows and financial condition, including: \\n\\n&#8226; our ability to continue to maintain and support the health, safety and well-being of our employees, including key employees; \\n\\n&#8226; disruptions to our global supply chain, including the closure of manufacturing and distribution facilities, due to, among other things, the lack of availability of raw and packaging materials or manufacturing components; a decrease in our workforce or in the efficiency of such workforce, including as a result of illness, travel restrictions, absenteeism or governmental regulations; transportation and logistics challenges, including as a result of port and border closures and other governmental restrictions or volume and capacity restraints; or the impact of a pandemic, epidemic or other health emergencies, such as the COVID-19 pandemic on our retailers, third party suppliers, contract manufacturers, logistics providers or distributors; \\n\\n&#8226; volatility in the demand for and availability of our products, which may be caused by the temporary inability of our consumers to purchase our products due to illness, financial hardship, quarantine, government actions mandating the closure of our facilities, distributors or retailers and/or imposing travel or movement restrictions, shifts in demand and consumption away from more discretionary or higher priced products to lower-priced products or pantry-loading activity; \\n\\n&#8226; changes in purchasing patterns of our consumers, including a shift to purchasing our products online and disruptions in certain channels; \\n\\n&#8226; significant volatility in demand for certain of our products, which may require us to increase our production capacity or acquire additional capacity at an additional cost and expense; \\n\\n&#8226; failure of third parties on which we rely, including our retailers, suppliers, contract manufacturers, logistics providers, customers, commercial banks, joint venture partners and external business partners, to meet their obligations to us, or significant disruptions in their ability to do so, which may be caused by their own financial or operational difficulties; \\n\\n&#8226; significant changes in the economic and political conditions of the markets in which we operate, which could restrict our employees&#8217; ability to work and travel, could mandate the closure of certain distributors or retailers, our offices, shared business service centers and/or operating and manufacturing facilities or otherwise could prevent us as well as our third-party partners, suppliers or customers from sufficiently staffing operations, including operations necessary for the manufacture, distribution, sale and support of our products; \\n\\n&#8226; disruptions and volatility in the global capital markets, including rising interest rates, which may increase the cost of capital and adversely impact our access to capital; and/or \\n\\n&#8226; volatility in foreign exchange rates and increases in the cost and availability of raw and packaging materials and transportation and logistics costs. \\n\\nDuring the COVID-19 pandemic, many of the communities in which we manufacture, market and sell our products experienced and may in the future experience &#8220;stay at home&#8221; orders, travel or movement restrictions and other government actions to address the pandemic. While the impact of COVID-19 on our business has largely abated at this time, uncertainties continue, particularly in China where we have substantial manufacturing facilities and business, and in the travel retail channel, where we have experienced and may continue to experience disruptions particularly in our Filorga business. We have also experienced and may continue to experience certain disruptions to our global supply chain due to COVID-19, which have impacted and may continue to impact sales of and consumer access to our products. We have also witnessed and may continue to witness changes in the purchasing patterns of our customers, including a shift in many markets to purchasing our products online. COVID-19 may continue to impact consumer behavior and preferences, shopping patterns and consumption preferences. Uncertainty resulting from COVID-19 could result in an unforeseen additional disruption to our business, including our global supply chain and retailer network, and/or require us to incur additional operational costs. \\n\\nThese and other risks related to COVID-19 have adversely affected and may continue to adversely affect our business, results of operations, cash flows and financial condition. Furthermore, these and other impacts of COVID-19 could also have the effect of heightening many of the other risk factors included in this Item 1A, &#8220;Risk Factors,&#8221; which could adversely affect our business, results of operations, cash flows and financial condition. For additional information regarding how COVID-19 has affected or is expected to affect our business, refer to Part II, Item 7 &#8220;Management&#8217;s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations &#8211; Executive Overview.&#8221; \\n\\nDamage to our reputation could have an adverse effect on our business. \\n\\nMaintaining our strong reputation with consumers and our trade partners globally is critical to selling our branded products. Accordingly, we devote significant time and resources to programs designed to protect and preserve our reputation, such as our ethics and compliance, ESG, brand protection and product safety, regulatory and quality initiatives. Negative publicity about us, our brands, our products, our supply chain, our ingredients, our packaging, our ESG practices, or our employees, whether or not deserved, could jeopardize our reputation. Such negative publicity could relate to, among other things, health concerns, threatened or pending litigation or regulatory proceedings, labor and human rights and environmental impact (including responsible sourcing, deforestation, packaging, plastic, energy and water use and waste management) or our ESG practices. In addition, the proliferation of digital and social media has greatly increased the accessibility of information and the speed of its dissemination and the potential for negative publicity. Negative publicity, posts or comments on digital and social media, whether true or untrue, could damage our brands and our reputation. The success of our brands could also suffer if our marketing initiatives do not have the desired impact on a brand&#8217;s image or its ability to attract consumers. \\n\\nAdditionally, due to the scale and scope of our business, we must rely on relationships with third parties, including our suppliers, distributors, contractors, joint venture partners and other external business partners, for certain functions. While we have policies and procedures for managing these relationships, they inherently involve a lesser degree of control over business operations, compliance and ESG practices, thereby potentially increasing our reputational and legal risk. \\n\\nWe have taken and in the future may take certain actions to safeguard our reputation and uphold our ethical values, such as changes to how and where we sell, advertise and invest behind our products and operations, which could adversely affect our business, results of operations, cash flows and financial condition. \\n\\nIn addition, third parties sell counterfeit versions of our products, which are inferior or may pose safety risks. As a result, consumers of our brands could confuse our products with these counterfeit products, which could cause them to refrain from purchasing our brands in the future and in turn could impair our brand equity and adversely affect our business, results of operations, cash flows and financial condition. \\n\\nDamage to our reputation or loss of consumer confidence in our products for these or any other reasons could adversely affect our business, results of operations, cash flows and financial condition, as well as require resources to rebuild our reputation. \\n\\nOur success depends upon our ability to recruit, attract and retain key employees, including through the implementation of diversity, equity and inclusion initiatives, and the succession of senior management. \\n\\nOur success largely depends on the performance of our management team and other key employees. If we are unable to recruit, attract and retain talented, highly qualified senior management and other key people, our business, results of operations, cash flows and financial condition could be adversely affected. Successfully executing organizational change, including management transitions at leadership levels of the Company and succession plans for senior management, is critical to our business success. While we follow a disciplined, ongoing succession planning process and have succession plans in place for senior management and other key executives, these do not guarantee that the services of qualified senior executives will continue to be available to us at particular moments in time. Further, changes in immigration laws and government policies, including related to the COVID-19 pandemic, have made, in certain circumstances, and may continue to make, it more difficult for us to recruit or relocate highly skilled technical, professional and management personnel to meet our business needs. Our ability to attract and retain talent has been and may continue to be impacted by challenges in the labor market, particularly in the United States, which has experienced and may continue to experience wage inflation, labor shortages and a shift toward a hybrid working model. In addition, we continue to work to advance culture change through the implementation of DE&#38;I initiatives throughout our organization. We continue to embed new ways of working throughout the organization to, among other things, instill a growth mindset to drive innovation with focus, empowerment, experimentation and digitization. If we do not (or are perceived not to) successfully implement these initiatives, our ability to recruit, attract and retain talent may be adversely impacted. \\n\\nWe have pursued and may continue to pursue acquisitions and divestitures, which could adversely impact our business. \\n\\nWe have pursued and may continue to pursue acquisitions of brands, businesses, assets or technologies from third parties. Acquisitions and their pursuit have involved, and can involve, numerous potential risks, including, among other things: \\n\\n&#8226; realizing the full extent of the expected benefits or synergies as a result of a transaction, within the anticipated time frame, or at all; \\n\\n&#8226; successfully integrating the operations, technologies, services, products and systems of the acquired brands, assets or businesses in an effective, timely and cost-efficient manner; \\n\\n&#8226; receiving necessary consents, clearances and approvals in connection with a transaction; \\n\\n&#8226; diverting management&#8217;s attention from other business priorities; \\n\\n&#8226; successfully operating in new lines of business, channels of distribution or markets; \\n\\n&#8226; achieving distribution expansion related to products, categories and markets; \\n\\n&#8226; retaining key employees, partners, suppliers and customers of the acquired business; \\n\\n&#8226; conforming standards, controls, procedures and policies of the acquired business with our own; \\n\\n&#8226; developing or launching products with acquired technologies; and \\n\\n&#8226; other unanticipated problems or liabilities. \\n\\nMoreover, acquisitions have resulted in and could in the future result in substantial additional debt, the assumption of contingent liabilities, such as litigation or earn-out obligations, or transaction costs. In addition, to the extent that the economic benefits associated with an acquisition or investment diminish in the future or the performance of an acquired \\n\\ncompany or business is less robust than expected, we may be required to record additional impairments of intangible assets, including trademarks and goodwill. For example, in the fourth quarter of 2022, we took non-cash, aftertax impairment charges of $620 million, to adjust the carrying values of goodwill and intangible assets related to the Filorga skin health business. For additional information regarding recent impairment charges, refer to Part II, Item 7 &#8220;Management&#8217;s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations - Results of Operations - Goodwill and Intangible Asset Impairment Charges.&#8221; Any of these risks could adversely impact our reputation and our business, results of operations, cash flows and financial condition. \\n\\nWe have divested and may in the future periodically divest brands or businesses. These divestitures may adversely impact our business, results of operations, cash flows and financial condition if we are unable to offset the dilutive impacts from the loss of revenue associated with the divested brands or businesses, or otherwise achieve the anticipated benefits or cost savings from the divestitures. In addition, businesses under consideration for, or otherwise subject to, divestiture may be adversely impacted prior to the divestiture, which could negatively impact our business, results of operations, cash flows and financial condition. \\n\\nOperational Risks \\n\\nOur business results are impacted by our ability to manage disruptions in our global supply chain and/or key office facilities. \\n\\nWe are engaged in the manufacture and sourcing of products and materials on a global scale. Our operations and those of our suppliers, contract manufacturers or logistics providers have been and may continue to be disrupted by a number of factors, including, but not limited to: \\n\\n&#8226; geopolitical events, wars and military conflicts, such as the war in Ukraine; \\n\\n&#8226; widespread health emergencies, such as COVID-19 or other pandemics or epidemics; \\n\\n&#8226; strikes and other labor disputes; \\n\\n&#8226; disruptions in logistics; \\n\\n&#8226; loss or impairment of key manufacturing or distribution sites; \\n\\n&#8226; loss of key suppliers or contract manufacturers; \\n\\n&#8226; capacity constraints; \\n\\n&#8226; raw material and product quality or safety issues; \\n\\n&#8226; industrial accidents or other occupational health and safety issues; \\n\\n&#8226; the impact on our suppliers of tighter credit or capital markets; \\n\\n&#8226; the lack of availability of qualified personnel, such as truck drivers and production labor; \\n\\n&#8226; governmental incentives and controls (including import and export restrictions, such as new or increased tariffs, sanctions, quotas or trade barriers); and \\n\\n&#8226; natural disasters, including climatic events (including any potential effects of climate change) and earthquakes, tornadoes, acts of war or terrorism, political unrest or uncertainty, fires or explosions, cyber-security incidents and other external factors over which we have no control. \\n\\nIn addition, we purchase certain key raw and packaging materials from single-source suppliers or a limited number of suppliers and new suppliers may have to be qualified under industry, governmental and/or Colgate standards, which can require additional investment and take a significant period of time. If our existing or new suppliers fail to meet such \\n\\nstandards or if we are unable to contract with suppliers on favorable terms, our business, results of operations, cash flows and financial condition could be adversely affected. \\n\\nWe believe that the supplies of raw and packaging materials needed to manufacture our products are adequate. In addition, we have business continuity and contingency plans in place for key manufacturing sites and contract manufacturers and the supply of raw and packaging materials. Nonetheless, a significant disruption to the manufacturing or sourcing of products or materials for any reason, including those mentioned above, have at times interrupted and could, in the future, interrupt product supply and, if not remedied, could have an adverse impact on our business, results of operations, cash flows and financial condition. \\n\\nIn addition, as a result of our global shared service organizational model, certain of our functions, such as finance and accounting, customer service and logistics, human resources, global information technology and data analytics are concentrated in key office facilities. A significant disruption to any of our key office facilities for any reason, including those mentioned above, could adversely affect our business, results of operations, cash flows and financial condition. \\n\\nVolatility in material and other costs could adversely impact our profitability. \\n\\nRaw and packaging material commodities, such as essential oils, resins, tropical oils, pulp, tallow, corn, poultry and soybeans, are subject to market price variations. Increases in the costs of and/or a reduction in the availability of commodities, energy and logistics (including trucks and containers) and other necessary services, including as a result of COVID-19 and/or the war in Ukraine, have affected and are likely to continue to adversely affect our profit margins. Inflationary pressures have also increased and may continue to increase the cost of such commodities and services. We have taken and may continue to take actions to mitigate these cost increases in the form of price increases and efforts to achieve cost efficiencies in areas such as manufacturing and distribution, or otherwise manage the exposure through sourcing strategies, ongoing productivity initiatives and the limited use of commodity hedging contracts. These actions may not, however, fully offset these higher costs and our business, results of operations, cash flows and financial condition have been and may continue to be adversely impacted. In addition, even if we are able to increase the prices of our products in response to commodity and other cost increases, we may not be able to sustain the price increases which may lead to declines in volume. If competitors do not adjust their prices or if consumers decide not to pay higher prices and forego purchasing certain of our products or switch to &#8220;private label&#8221; or lower-priced product offerings, sales declines, a deterioration in our profitability and loss of market share may occur which could adversely affect our business, results of operations, cash flows and financial condition. See &#8220;Our business results depend on our ability to manage disruptions in our global supply chain and/or key office facilities&#8221; above for additional information. \\n\\nThere is no guarantee that our ongoing efforts to reduce costs will be successful. \\n\\nOne way that we generate funds needed to support the growth of our business is through our continuous, Company-wide initiatives to lower costs and increase effective asset utilization, which we refer to as our funding-the-growth initiatives. These initiatives are designed to reduce costs associated with direct materials, indirect expenses, distribution and logistics, and advertising and promotional materials, among other things. The achievement of our funding-the-growth goals depends on our ability to successfully identify and realize additional savings opportunities. Events and circumstances, such as financial or strategic difficulties, delays and unexpected costs may occur that could result in our not realizing any or all of the anticipated benefits or our not realizing the anticipated benefits on our expected timetable. If we are unable to realize the anticipated savings of our funding-the-growth initiatives, our ability to fund other initiatives and achieve our profitability goals may be adversely affected. Any failure to implement our funding-the-growth initiatives in accordance with our expectations could adversely affect our business, results of operations, cash flows and financial condition. For additional information regarding our funding-the-growth initiatives, refer to Part II, Item 7 &#8220;Management&#8217;s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations &#8211; Executive Overview.&#8221; \\n\\nWe may not fully realize the benefits that we expect from our 2022 Global Productivity Initiative . \\n\\nOn January 27, 2022, the Board approved a targeted productivity program (the &#8220;2022 Global Productivity Initiative&#8221;). The program is intended to reallocate resources toward our strategic priorities and faster growth businesses, drive efficiencies in our operations and streamline our supply chain to reduce structural costs. The successful implementation of the program may present organizational challenges and, in some cases, may require successful negotiations with third parties. As a result, we may not be able to fully realize all of the anticipated benefits from the 2022 Global Productivity Initiative. Events and circumstances, such as financial or strategic difficulties, delays and unexpected costs may occur that \\n\\ncould result in our not realizing all of the anticipated benefits or our not realizing such benefits on our expected timetable. In addition, changes in foreign exchange rates or in tax, labor or immigration laws may result in our not achieving the anticipated cost savings as measured in U.S. dollars. If we are unable to fully realize the anticipated savings from the 2022 Global Productivity Initiative, our ability to fund other initiatives and enhance profitability may be adversely affected. Any failure to implement the 2022 Global Productivity Initiative in accordance with our expectations could adversely affect our business, results of operations, cash flows and financial condition. For additional information regarding the 2022 Global Productivity Initiative, refer to Part II, Item 7 &#8220;Management&#8217;s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations &#8211; Restructuring and Related Implementation Charges.&#8221; \\n\\nA cyber-security incident, data breach or a failure of a key information technology system could adversely impact our business. \\n\\nWe rely extensively on information technology systems (&#8220;IT Systems&#8221;), including some which are managed, hosted, provided and/or used by third parties, including cloud-based service providers, and their vendors, in order to conduct our business. Our uses of these systems include, but are not limited to: \\n\\n&#8226; communicating within our company and with other parties, including our customers and consumers; \\n\\n&#8226; ordering and managing materials from suppliers; \\n\\n&#8226; converting materials to finished products; \\n\\n&#8226; receiving and processing orders from, shipping products to and invoicing our customers and consumers; \\n\\n&#8226; marketing products to consumers; \\n\\n&#8226; collecting, storing, transferring and/or processing customer, consumer, employee, vendor, investor and other stakeholder information and personal data, including, but not limited to, such data from residents of states, countries and regions with important data protection laws and regulations; \\n\\n&#8226; processing transactions, including but not limited to employee payroll, employee and retiree benefits and payments to customers and vendors; \\n\\n&#8226; hosting, processing and sharing confidential and proprietary research, intellectual property, business plans and financial information; \\n\\n&#8226; summarizing and reporting results of operations, including financial reporting; \\n\\n&#8226; managing our banking and other cash liquidity systems and platforms; \\n\\n&#8226; complying with legal, regulatory and tax requirements; \\n\\n&#8226; providing data security; and \\n\\n&#8226; handling other processes involved in managing our business. \\n\\nAlthough we have a broad array of information security measures in place, our IT Systems, including those of third-party service providers with whom we have contracted, have been, and will likely continue to be, subject to computer viruses or other malicious codes, unauthorized access attempts, phishing and other cyber-attacks. Cyber-attacks and other cyber incidents are occurring more frequently, are constantly evolving in nature, are becoming more sophisticated and are being made by groups, individuals and nation states with a wide range of expertise and motives. Such cyber-attacks and cyber incidents can take many forms, including cyber extortion, social engineering, password theft or introduction of viruses or malware, such as ransomware through phishing emails. We cannot guarantee that our security efforts will prevent breaches or breakdowns of our, or our third-party service providers&#8217;, IT Systems since the techniques used in these attacks change frequently and may be difficult to detect for periods of time. In addition, although we have policies and procedures in place to ensure that all personal information collected by us or our third-party service providers is securely maintained, data leakages due to human error or intentional or unintentional conduct have occurred and likely will continue \\n\\nto occur. Furthermore, we periodically upgrade our IT Systems or adopt new technologies. If such an upgrade or new technology does not function as designed, does not go as planned or increases our exposure to a cyber-attack or cyber incident, it may adversely impact our business, including our ability to ship products to customers, issue invoices and process payments or order raw and packaging materials. Although we have seen no material impact on our business operations from the cyber-security incidents we have experienced to date, if we suffer a significant loss or disclosure of confidential business or stakeholder information as a result of a breach of our IT Systems, including those of third-party service providers with whom we have contracted, or otherwise, we may suffer reputational, competitive and/or business harm, incur significant costs and be subject to government investigations, litigation, fines and/or damages, which may adversely impact our business, results of operations, cash flows and financial condition. In addition, while we currently maintain insurance coverage that, subject to its terms and conditions, is intended to address costs associated with certain aspects of cyber-security incidents and IT System failures, this insurance coverage may not, depending on the specific facts and circumstances surrounding an incident, cover all losses or all types of claims that arise from an incident, or the damage to our business, reputation or brands that may result from an incident. \\n\\nFurthermore, while we have disaster recovery and business continuity plans in place, if our IT Systems are damaged, breached or cease to function properly for any reason, including the poor performance of, failure of or cyber-attack on third-party service providers, catastrophic events, power outages, cyber-security breaches, network outages, failed upgrades or other similar events and, if the disaster recovery and business continuity plans do not effectively resolve such issues on a timely basis, we may suffer interruptions in our ability to manage or conduct business as well as reputational harm, and may be subject to governmental investigations and litigation, any of which may adversely impact our business, results of operations, cash flows and financial condition. \\n\\nClimate change and other sustainability matters could have an adverse impact on our business and results of operations. \\n\\nClimate change resulting from increased concentrations of carbon dioxide and other greenhouse gases (&#8220;GHG&#8221;) in the atmosphere and its impact on global temperatures, weather patterns and the frequency and severity of natural disasters and other extreme weather conditions may adversely impact our business, results of operations, cash flows and financial condition. Specifically, the predicted effects of climate change may exacerbate challenges regarding the availability and quality of water and the cost, quality and availability of raw and packaging materials, pose physical risks to our facilities and those of our key suppliers, disrupt our global supply chain or impact demand for our products. In addition, the increased concern over climate change has resulted and is likely to continue to result in additional legal and regulatory requirements intended to, among other things, reduce or mitigate the effects of climate change and have related and may relate to, among other things, GHG emissions (e.g., carbon pricing), alternative energy policy and additional disclosure obligations. Such additional regulation may adversely affect our business, results of operations, cash flows and financial condition by increasing our compliance and manufacturing costs and/or negatively impacting our reputation if we are unable to, or are perceived (whether or not valid) not to, satisfy such requirements or expectations. Achieving our sustainability and social impact targets will require significant efforts from us and other stakeholders, such as our suppliers and other third parties. It will also require capital investment, additional expense (e.g., renewable energy costs) and the development of technology that may not currently exist. Any failure to achieve our sustainability and social impact targets or the perception (whether or not valid) that we have failed to act responsibly with respect to such matters or to effectively respond to new or additional legal or regulatory requirements regarding climate change or other sustainability matters, could result in adverse publicity and adversely affect our business and reputation. There is also increased focus, including by governmental and non-governmental organizations, investors, customers, consumers, regulators, our employees and other stakeholders on these and other sustainability and social impact matters, including responsible sourcing and deforestation, the use of plastic, energy and water, the recyclability or recoverability of packaging, including single-use and other plastic packaging, and a growing demand for natural or organic products and ingredients and ingredient transparency. Our reputation could be damaged if we do not (or are perceived not to) act responsibly with respect to sustainability matters, which could adversely affect our business, results of operations, cash flows and financial condition. \\n\\nLegal and Regulatory Risks \\n\\nOur business is subject to legal and regulatory risks in the U.S. and abroad. \\n\\nOur business is subject to extensive legal and regulatory requirements in the U.S. and abroad. Such legal and regulatory requirements apply to most aspects of our products, including their development, ingredients, formulation, manufacture, packaging content, labeling, storage, transportation, distribution, export, import, advertising, sale and environmental impact. U.S. federal authorities, including the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (the &#8220;FDA&#8221;), the Federal Trade Commission, the Consumer Product Safety Commission, the Occupational Safety and Health Administration and the \\n\\nEnvironmental Protection Agency, regulate different aspects of our business, along with parallel authorities at the state and local levels and comparable authorities overseas. In addition, our selling practices are regulated by competition law authorities in the U.S. and abroad. \\n\\nNew or more stringent legal or regulatory requirements, or more restrictive interpretations of existing requirements, could adversely impact our business, results of operations, cash flows and financial condition. For example, from time to time, various regulatory authorities around the world review the use of various ingredients and packaging content in consumer products. While we monitor and seek to mitigate the impact of any emerging information, a decision by a regulatory or governmental authority that any ingredient or packaging content in our products should be restricted or should otherwise be newly regulated could adversely impact our business and reputation, as could negative reactions by our consumers, trade customers or non-governmental organizations to our current or prior use of such ingredients or packaging. Additionally, an inability to develop new or reformulated products containing alternative ingredients, to obtain regulatory approval of such products or ingredients on a timely basis or to effectively market and sell such products could likewise adversely affect our business. \\n\\nBecause of our extensive international operations, we could be adversely affected by violations of worldwide anti-bribery laws, including those that prohibit companies and their intermediaries from making improper payments to government officials or other third parties for the purpose of obtaining or retaining business, such as the U.S. Foreign Corrupt Practices Act, and laws that prohibit commercial bribery. We are also subject to laws and sanctions imposed by the U.S. (including, without limitation, those imposed by OFAC) and/or by other jurisdictions that may prohibit us or certain of our affiliates from doing business in certain countries, or restrict the kind of business that may be conducted. While our policies mandate compliance with these laws, we cannot provide assurance that our internal control policies and procedures will always protect us from reckless or criminal acts committed by our employees, joint venture partners or agents. Violations of these laws, or allegations of such violations, could disrupt our business and adversely affect our reputation and our business, results of operations, cash flows and financial condition. \\n\\nWhile it is our policy and practice to comply with all legal and regulatory requirements applicable to our business, findings that we are in violation of, or out of compliance with, applicable laws or regulations have subjected us to, and could subject us to, civil remedies, including fines, damages, injunctions or product recalls, or criminal sanctions, any of which could adversely affect our business, results of operations, cash flows and financial condition. Even if a claim is unsuccessful, is without merit or is not fully pursued, the cost of responding to such a claim, including management time and out-of-pocket expenses, and the negative publicity surrounding such assertions regarding our products, processes or business practices could adversely affect our reputation, brand image and our business, results of operations, cash flows and financial condition. For information regarding our legal and regulatory matters, see Item 3 &#8220;Legal Proceedings&#8221; and Note 13, Commitments and Contingencies to the Consolidated Financial Statements. \\n\\nLegal claims and proceedings could adversely impact our business. \\n\\nAs a global company serving consumers in more than 200 countries and territories, we are and may continue to be subject to a wide variety of legal claims and proceedings, including disputes relating to intellectual property, contracts, product liability, marketing, advertising, foreign exchange controls, antitrust and trade regulation, as well as labor and employment, pension, data privacy and security, environmental and tax matters and consumer class actions. Regardless of their merit, these claims can require significant time and expense to investigate and defend. Since litigation is inherently uncertain, there is no guarantee that we will be successful in defending ourselves against such claims or proceedings, or that our assessment of the materiality of these matters, including any reserves taken in connection therewith, will be consistent with the ultimate outcome of such matters. In addition, if one of our products, or an ingredient contained in our products, is perceived or found to be defective, or unsafe or have a quality issue, we have had to and may in the future need to withdraw, recall or reformulate some of our products. Whether or not a legal claim or proceeding is successful, or a withdrawal, recall or reformulation is required or advisable, such assertions could have an adverse effect on our business, results of operations, cash flows and financial condition, and the negative publicity surrounding them could harm our reputation and brand image. The resolution of, or increase in the reserves taken in connection with, one or more of these matters in any reporting period could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations, cash flows and financial condition for that period. See Item 3 &#8220;Legal Proceedings&#8221; and Note 13, Commitments and Contingencies to the Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information on certain of our legal claims and proceedings. \\n\\nFinancial and Economic Risks \\n\\nUncertain or unfavorable global economic conditions may adversely affect our business. \\n\\nUncertain or unfavorable global economic conditions could adversely affect our business. Unfavorable global economic conditions, such as a recession, an economic slowdown, inflation, higher interest rates and/or reduced category growth rates, including as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic and/or the war in Ukraine, have negatively impacted and could negatively impact our business and result in declining revenues, profitability and/or cash flows. Although we continue to devote significant resources to support our brands and market our products at multiple price points, during periods of economic uncertainty or unfavorable economic conditions, consumers may reduce consumption or discretionary spending and/or change their purchasing patterns by foregoing purchasing certain of our products or by switching to &#8220;private label,&#8221; or lower-priced product offerings. These changes could reduce demand for our products or result in a shift in our product mix, as consumers may choose products that sell at lower prices. Additionally, our retailers may be impacted and they may increase pressure on our selling prices or increase promotional activity for lower-priced or value offerings as they seek to maintain sales volumes and margins. Furthermore, economic conditions can cause our suppliers, distributors, contract manufacturers, logistics providers or other third-party partners to suffer financial or operational difficulties, which may impact their inability to provide us with or distribute finished product, raw and packaging materials and/or services in a timely manner or at all. In addition, we could face difficulty collecting or recovering accounts receivables from third parties facing financial or operational difficulties. \\n\\nDisruptions in the credit markets or changes to our credit ratings may adversely affect our business. \\n\\nWhile we currently generate significant cash flows from ongoing operations and have access to global credit markets through our various financing activities, a disruption or volatility in the credit markets, interest rate increases or changes to our credit rating or changes that may result from the continued implementation of new benchmark rates that are replacing the London Interbank Offered Rate (&#8220;LIBOR&#8221;) could negatively impact the availability or cost of funding. Reduced access to credit or increased costs could adversely affect our liquidity and capital resources or significantly increase our cost of capital. In addition, if any financial institutions that hold our cash or other investments or that are parties to our undrawn revolving credit facility supporting our commercial paper programs or other financing arrangements, such as interest rate, foreign exchange or commodity hedging instruments, were to declare bankruptcy or become insolvent, they may be unable to perform under their agreements with us. This could leave us with reduced borrowing capacity or unhedged against certain interest rate, foreign currency or commodity price exposures. In addition, tighter or more volatile credit markets may lead to business disruptions for certain of our suppliers, contract manufacturers or trade customers which could, in turn, adversely impact our business, results of operations, cash flows and financial condition. \\n\\nTax matters, including changes in tax rates, disagreements with taxing authorities and imposition of new taxes could negatively impact our business. \\n\\nWe are subject to taxes in the U.S. and in the foreign jurisdictions where we do business. Due to economic and political conditions, tax rates in the U.S. and various foreign jurisdictions have been and may be subject to significant change. Changes in the mix of our earnings between countries with differing statutory tax rates, changes in the valuation of deferred tax assets and liabilities related to changes in tax rates, changes in tax laws, including how existing tax laws are interpreted or enforced, or contemplated changes in long-standing tax principles, if finalized and adopted, could adversely impact our future effective tax rate and business, results of operations, cash flows and financial condition. For example, long-standing international tax norms that determine each country&#8217;s jurisdiction to tax cross-border international trade are evolving as a result of a multilateral project, the Base Erosion and Profit Shifting Project (the &#8220;BEPS Project&#8221;), that has established new principles and reporting requirements recommended by the member countries of the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development (the &#8220;OECD&#8221;). In connection with the BEPS Project, companies are required to disclose more information to tax authorities on operations around the world, which may lead to greater audit scrutiny of profits earned in countries outside of the U.S. Many jurisdictions have already enacted legislation and adopted policies resulting from the BEPS Project. The OECD, is also addressing the challenges of the digitization of the global economy with plans to redefine jurisdictional taxation rights in market countries and establish a global minimum tax. In addition, we are evaluating the impact of recent legislation in the U.S., such as the Inflation Reduction Act of 2022 that, among other things, provides for a corporate alternative minimum tax, and in the European Union, such as the Minimum Tax Directive that provides for a minimum level of taxation for certain large corporations in every jurisdiction in which they operate. As these and other tax laws and related regulations change, our business, results of operations, cash flows and financial condition could be materially impacted. For more information regarding recent legislation, refer to Part II, Item 7 \\n\\n\"Management\\'s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations - Results of Operations - Income Taxes.\" \\n\\nFurthermore, we are subject to regular reviews, examinations and audits by the Internal Revenue Service and other taxing authorities with respect to taxes inside and outside of the U.S. Although we believe our tax positions are reasonable, when a taxing authority disagrees with the positions we have taken, we have faced and in the future may face additional tax liabilities, including interest and penalties, in excess of reserves. The payment of such additional amounts upon final adjudication of any disputes could adversely impact our business, results of operations, cash flows and financial condition. \\n\\n'"

SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES \\xa0Fiscal Year — The fiscal year of Conagra Brands, Inc. (\"Conagra Brands\", \"Company\", \"we\", \"us\", or \"our\") ends the last Sunday in May. The fiscal years for the consolidated financial statements presented consist of a 52 -week period for fiscal 2023 , 2022 , and 2021 .\\xa0Basis of Consolidation — The consolidated financial statements include the accounts of Conagra Brands, Inc. and all majority-owned subsidiaries. All significant intercompany investments, accounts, and transactions have been eliminated.\\xa0Investments in Unconsolidated Affiliates — The investments in, and the operating results of, 50% -or-less-owned entities not required to be consolidated are included in the consolidated financial statements on the basis of the equity method of accounting.\\xa0We review our investments in unconsolidated affiliates for impairment whenever events or changes in business circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of the investments may not be fully recoverable. Evidence of a loss in value that is other than temporary includes, but is not limited to, the absence of an ability to recover the carrying amount of the investment, the inability of the investee to sustain an earnings capacity that would justify the carrying amount of the investment, or, where applicable, estimated sales proceeds which are insufficient to recover the carrying amount of the investment. Management\\'s assessment as to whether any decline in value is other than temporary is based on our ability and intent to hold the investment and whether evidence indicating the carrying value of the investment is recoverable within a reasonable period of time outweighs evidence to the contrary. Management generally considers our investments in equity method investees to be strategic long-term investments. Therefore, management completes its assessments with a long-term viewpoint. If the fair value of the investment is determined to be less than the carrying value and the decline in value is considered to be other than temporary, an appropriate write-down is recorded based on the excess of the carrying value over the best estimate of fair value of the investment.\\xa0', 'Cash and Cash Equivalents — Cash and all highly liquid investments with an original maturity of three months or less at the date of acquisition, including short-term time deposits and government agency and corporate obligations, are classified as cash and cash equivalents.', '\\xa0Receivables — Receivables from customers generally do not bear interest. Terms and collection vary by location and channel. The allowance for doubtful accounts represents our estimate of probable non-payments and credit losses in our existing receivables, as determined based on a review of past due balances and other specific account data. Account balances are written off against the allowance when we deem them uncollectible.\\xa0The following table details the balances of our allowance for doubtful accounts and changes therein:\\xa0 \\xa0 \\xa0 Balance at Beginning of Period \\xa0 \\xa0 Additions Charged to Costs and Expenses \\xa0 \\xa0 Other 1 \\xa0 \\xa0 Deductions from Reserves 2 \\xa0 \\xa0 Balance at Close of Period \\xa0 Year ended May 28, 2023\\xa0 $ 3.9 \\xa0 \\xa0 \\xa0 0.1 \\xa0 \\xa0 \\xa0 ( 0.1 ) \\xa0 \\xa0 0.1 \\xa0 \\xa0 $ 3.8 \\xa0 Year ended May 29, 2022\\xa0 $ 3.2 \\xa0 \\xa0 \\xa0 1.4 \\xa0 \\xa0 \\xa0 — \\xa0 \\xa0 \\xa0 0.7 \\xa0 \\xa0 $ 3.9 \\xa0 Year ended May 30, 2021\\xa0 $ 2.6 \\xa0 \\xa0 \\xa0 0.6 \\xa0 \\xa0 \\xa0 0.7 \\xa0 \\xa0 \\xa0 0.7 \\xa0 \\xa0 $ 3.2 \\xa0  \\xa01 Primarily relates to translation and the adoption of Accounting Standards Update (\"ASU\") 2016 - 13. 2 Bad debts charged off and adjustments to previous reserves, less recoveries.\\xa0Inventories — We use the lower of cost (determined using the first -in, first -out method) or net realizable value for valuing inventories.\\xa0Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements Fiscal Years Ended May 28, 2023, May 29, 2022, and May 30, 2021 (columnar dollars in millions except per share amounts) \\xa0 Property, Plant and Equipment — Property, plant and equipment are carried at cost. Depreciation has been calculated using the straight-line method over the estimated useful lives of the respective classes of assets as follows:\\xa0 \\xa0 \\xa0 Years\\xa0 Land improvements\\xa0 \\xa0 1 - 40 \\xa0 Buildings\\xa0 \\xa0 15 - 40 \\xa0 Machinery and equipment\\xa0 \\xa0 3 - 20 \\xa0 Furniture, fixtures, office equipment and other\\xa0 \\xa0 5 - 15 \\xa0  \\xa0We review property, plant and equipment for impairment whenever events or changes in business circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of the assets may not be fully recoverable. Recoverability of an asset considered \"held-and-used\" is determined by comparing the carrying amount of the asset to the undiscounted net cash flows expected to be generated from the use of the asset. If the carrying amount is greater than the undiscounted net cash flows expected to be generated by the asset, the asset\\'s carrying amount is reduced to its estimated fair value. An asset considered \"held-for-sale\" is reported at the lower of the asset\\'s carrying amount or fair value.\\xa0During fiscal 2023, 2022, and 2021 , our capital expenditures totaled $ 362.2 million, $ 464.4 million, and $ 506.4 million, respectively. Accrued and unpaid capital expenditures as of May 28, 2023 , May 29, 2022 , May 30, 2021 , and May 31, 2020 totaled $ 128.3 million, $ 108.8 million, $ 123.7 million, and $ 112.9 million, respectively.\\xa0Goodwill and Other Identifiable Intangible Assets — Goodwill and other identifiable intangible assets with indefinite lives (e.g., brands or trademarks) are not amortized and are tested annually for impairment of value and whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate the carrying amount of the asset may be impaired. A significant amount of judgment is involved in determining if an indicator of impairment has occurred. Such indicators may include deterioration in general economic conditions, adverse changes in the markets in which an entity operates, increases in input costs that have negative effects on earnings and cash flows, or a trend of negative or declining cash flows over multiple periods, among others. The fair value that could be realized in an actual transaction may differ from that used to evaluate the impairment of goodwill and other intangible assets.\\xa0In testing goodwill for impairment, we have the option to first assess qualitative factors to determine whether the existence of events or circumstances leads to a determination that it is more likely than not (more than 50% ) that the estimated fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying amount. If we elect to perform a qualitative assessment and determine that an impairment is more likely than not, we are then required to perform a quantitative impairment test, otherwise no further analysis is required. We also may elect not to perform the qualitative assessment and, instead, proceed directly to the quantitative impairment test.\\xa0Under the goodwill qualitative assessment, various events and circumstances that would affect the estimated fair value of a reporting unit are identified (similar to impairment indicators above). Furthermore, management considers the results of the most recent quantitative impairment test completed for a reporting unit and compares the weighted average cost of capital between the current and prior years for each reporting unit.\\xa0Under the goodwill quantitative impairment test, the evaluation of impairment involves comparing the current fair value of each reporting unit to its carrying value, including goodwill. We estimate the fair value using level 3 inputs as defined by the fair value hierarchy. Refer to Note 18 for the definition of the levels in the fair value hierarchy. The inputs used to calculate the fair value include a number of subjective factors, such as estimates of future cash flows, estimates of our future cost structure, discount rates for our estimated cash flows, required level of working capital, assumed terminal value, and time horizon of cash flow forecasts.\\xa0In assessing indefinite-lived intangible assets not subject to amortization for impairment, we have the option to perform a qualitative assessment to determine whether the existence of events or circumstances leads to a determination that it is more likely than not that the fair value of such an intangible asset is less than its carrying amount. If we determine that it is not more likely than not that the fair value of such an intangible asset is less than its carrying amount, then we are not required to perform any additional tests for assessing intangible assets for impairment. However, if we conclude otherwise or elect not to perform the qualitative assessment, then we are required to perform a quantitative impairment test that involves a comparison of the estimated fair value of the intangible asset with its carrying value. If the carrying value of the intangible asset exceeds its fair value, an impairment loss is recognized in an amount equal to that excess.\\xa0Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements Fiscal Years Ended May 28, 2023, May 29, 2022, and May 30, 2021 (columnar dollars in millions except per share amounts) \\xa0 In fiscal 2023, 2022, and 2021 we elected to perform a quantitative impairment test for indefinite-lived intangible assets not subject to amortization. The estimates of fair value of intangible assets not subject to amortization are determined using a \"relief from royalty\" methodology, which is used in estimating the fair value of our brands/trademarks. Discount rate assumptions are based on an assessment of the risk inherent in the projected future cash flows generated by the respective intangible assets. Also subject to judgment are assumptions about royalty rates.\\xa0Identifiable intangible assets with definite lives (e.g., licensing arrangements with contractual lives or customer relationships) are amortized over their estimated useful lives and tested for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate the carrying amount of the asset may be impaired. Identifiable intangible assets with definite lives are evaluated for impairment using a process similar to that used in evaluating elements of property, plant and equipment. If impaired, the asset is written down to its fair value.\\xa0Refer to Note 7 for discussion of the impairment charges related to goodwill and intangible assets in fiscal 2023, 2022, and 2021 .\\xa0Fair Values of Financial Instruments — Unless otherwise specified, we believe the carrying value of financial instruments approximates their fair value.\\xa0Environmental Liabilities — Environmental liabilities are accrued when it is probable that obligations have been incurred and the associated amounts can be reasonably estimated. We use third -party specialists to assist management in appropriately measuring the obligations associated with environmental liabilities. Such liabilities are adjusted as new information develops or circumstances change. We do not discount our environmental liabilities as the timing of the anticipated cash payments is not fixed or readily determinable. Management\\'s estimate of our potential liability is independent of any potential recovery of insurance proceeds or indemnification arrangements. We do not reduce our environmental liabilities for potential insurance recoveries.\\xa0Employment-Related Benefits — Employment-related benefits associated with pensions, postretirement health care benefits, and workers\\' compensation are expensed as such obligations are incurred. The recognition of expense is impacted by estimates made by management, such as discount rates used to value these liabilities, future health care costs, and employee accidents incurred but not yet reported. We use third -party specialists to assist management in appropriately measuring the obligations associated with employment-related benefits.\\xa0We recognize changes in the fair value of pension plan assets and net actuarial gains or losses in excess of 10% of the greater of the market-related value of plan assets or the plan\\'s projected benefit obligation (the \"corridor\") in current period expense annually as of our measurement date, which is our fiscal year-end, or when measurement is required otherwise under accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America (\"U.S. GAAP\").\\xa0Revenue Recognition — Our revenues primarily consist of the sale of food products that are sold to retailers and foodservice customers through direct sales forces, broker, and distributor arrangements. These revenue contracts generally have single performance obligations. Revenue, which includes shipping and handling charges billed to the customer, is reported net of variable consideration and consideration payable to our customers, including applicable discounts, returns, allowances, trade promotion, consumer coupon redemption, unsaleable product, and other costs. Amounts billed and due from our customers are classified as receivables and require payment on a short-term basis and, therefore, we do not have any significant financing components.\\xa0We recognize revenue when (or as) performance obligations are satisfied by transferring control of the goods to customers. Control is transferred upon delivery of the goods to the customer. Shipping and/or handling costs that occur before the customer obtains control of the goods are deemed to be fulfillment activities and are accounted for as fulfillment costs. We assess the goods and services promised in our customers\\' purchase orders and identify a performance obligation for each promise to transfer a good or service (or bundle of goods or services) that is distinct.\\xa0Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements Fiscal Years Ended May 28, 2023, May 29, 2022, and May 30, 2021 (columnar dollars in millions except per share amounts) \\xa0 We offer various forms of trade promotions and the methodologies for determining these provisions are dependent on local customer pricing and promotional practices, which range from contractually fixed percentage price reductions to provisions based on actual occurrence or performance. Our promotional activities are conducted either through the retail trade or directly with consumers and include activities such as in-store displays and events, feature price discounts, consumer coupons, and loyalty programs. The costs of these activities are recognized at the time the related revenue is recorded, which normally precedes the actual cash expenditure. The recognition of these costs therefore requires management judgment regarding the volume of promotional offers that will be redeemed by either the retail trade or consumer. These estimates are made using various techniques including historical data on performance of similar promotional programs. Differences between estimated expense and actual redemptions are recognized as a change in management estimate in a subsequent period.\\xa0Advertising Costs — Advertising costs are expensed as incurred. Advertising and promotion expenses totaled $ 290.1 million, $ 244.6 million, and $ 258.0 million in fiscal 2023, 2022, and 2021 , respectively, and are included in selling, general and administrative (\"SG&A\") expenses.\\xa0Research and Development — We incurred expenses of $ 57.7 million, $ 53.4 million, and $ 51.3 million for research and development activities in fiscal 2023, 2022, and 2021 , respectively.\\xa0Comprehensive Income — Comprehensive income includes net income, currency translation adjustments, certain derivative-related activity, and changes in prior service cost and net actuarial gains (losses) from pension (for amounts not in excess of the 10% \"corridor\") and postretirement health care plans. On foreign investments we deem to be essentially permanent in nature, we do not provide for taxes on currency translation adjustments arising from converting an investment denominated in a foreign currency to U.S. dollars. A deferred tax liability is recorded on currency translation adjustments related to undistributed foreign earnings that are not deemed to be permanently reinvested.\\xa0The following table details the accumulated balances for each component of other comprehensive income (loss), net of tax:\\xa0 \\xa0 \\xa0 2023 \\xa0 \\xa0 2022 \\xa0 \\xa0 2021 \\xa0 Currency translation losses, net of reclassification adjustments\\xa0 $ ( 99.7 ) \\xa0 $ ( 95.1 ) \\xa0 $ ( 77.1 ) Derivative adjustments, net of reclassification adjustments\\xa0 \\xa0 29.2 \\xa0 \\xa0 \\xa0 29.8 \\xa0 \\xa0 \\xa0 24.3 \\xa0 Pension and postretirement benefit obligations, net of reclassification adjustments\\xa0 \\xa0 26.1 \\xa0 \\xa0 \\xa0 54.1 \\xa0 \\xa0 \\xa0 58.6 \\xa0 Accumulated other comprehensive income (loss)\\xa0 $ ( 44.4 ) \\xa0 $ ( 11.2 ) \\xa0 $ 5.8 \\xa0  \\xa0Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements Fiscal Years Ended May 28, 2023, May 29, 2022, and May 30, 2021 (columnar dollars in millions except per share amounts) \\xa0 The following table summarizes the reclassifications from accumulated other comprehensive income (loss) into income:\\xa0 \\xa0 \\xa0 \\xa0 \\xa0 \\xa0 \\xa0 \\xa0 \\xa0 \\xa0 \\xa0 \\xa0 \\xa0 \\xa0 \\xa0 Affected Line Item in the Consolidated Statement of Earnings 1 \\xa0 \\xa0 2023 \\xa0 \\xa0 2022 \\xa0 \\xa0 2021 \\xa0 \\xa0 \\xa0 Net derivative adjustments:\\xa0 \\xa0 \\xa0 \\xa0 \\xa0 \\xa0 \\xa0 \\xa0 \\xa0 \\xa0 \\xa0 \\xa0 \\xa0 \\xa0 Cash flow hedges\\xa0 $ ( 3.3 ) \\xa0 $ ( 3.1 ) \\xa0 $ ( 3.2 ) \\xa0 Interest expense, net Cash flow hedges\\xa0 \\xa0 — \\xa0 \\xa0 \\xa0 — \\xa0 \\xa0 \\xa0 ( 0.5 ) \\xa0 Selling, general and administrative expenses Cash flow hedges\\xa0 \\xa0 ( 1.6 ) \\xa0 \\xa0 1.8 \\xa0 \\xa0 \\xa0 2.1 \\xa0 \\xa0 Equity method investment earnings \\xa0 \\xa0 \\xa0 ( 4.9 ) \\xa0 \\xa0 ( 1.3 ) \\xa0 \\xa0 ( 1.6 ) \\xa0 Total before tax \\xa0 \\xa0 \\xa0 1.2 \\xa0 \\xa0 \\xa0 0.4 \\xa0 \\xa0 \\xa0 1.0 \\xa0 \\xa0 Income tax expense \\xa0 \\xa0 $ ( 3.7 ) \\xa0 $ ( 0.9 ) \\xa0 $ ( 0.6 ) \\xa0 Net of tax Amortization of pension and postretirement benefit obligations:\\xa0 \\xa0 \\xa0 \\xa0 \\xa0 \\xa0 \\xa0 \\xa0 \\xa0 \\xa0 \\xa0 \\xa0 \\xa0 \\xa0 Net prior service cost (benefit)\\xa0 $ ( 0.1 ) \\xa0 $ 0.1 \\xa0 \\xa0 $ 0.2 \\xa0 \\xa0 Pension and postretirement non-service income Net actuarial gain\\xa0 \\xa0 ( 4.4 ) \\xa0 \\xa0 ( 3.6 ) \\xa0 \\xa0 ( 3.5 ) \\xa0 Pension and postretirement non-service income Postretirement healthcare settlement\\xa0 \\xa0 — \\xa0 \\xa0 \\xa0 — \\xa0 \\xa0 \\xa0 ( 0.5 ) \\xa0 Pension and postretirement non-service income Curtailment\\xa0 \\xa0 — \\xa0 \\xa0 \\xa0 — \\xa0 \\xa0 \\xa0 0.2 \\xa0 \\xa0 Pension and postretirement non-service income \\xa0 \\xa0 \\xa0 ( 4.5 ) \\xa0 \\xa0 ( 3.5 ) \\xa0 \\xa0 ( 3.6 ) \\xa0 Total before tax \\xa0 \\xa0 \\xa0 1.3 \\xa0 \\xa0 \\xa0 1.0 \\xa0 \\xa0 \\xa0 0.9 \\xa0 \\xa0 Income tax expense \\xa0 \\xa0 $ ( 3.2 ) \\xa0 $ ( 2.5 ) \\xa0 $ ( 2.7 ) \\xa0 Net of tax  \\xa01 Amounts in parentheses indicate income recognized in the Consolidated Statements of Earnings.\\xa0Foreign Currency Transaction Gains and Losses — We recognized net foreign currency transaction losses of $ 2.8 million and $ 2.5 million in fiscal 2023 and 2022 , respectively, and net foreign currency transaction gains of $ 8.2 million in fiscal 2021 in SG&A expenses.\\xa0', 'Business Combinations — We use the acquisition method in accounting for acquired businesses.

RESTRUCTURING ACTIVITIES \\xa0Conagra Restructuring Plan \\xa0In fiscal 2019, senior management initiated a restructuring plan for costs incurred in connection with actions taken to improve SG&A expense effectiveness and efficiencies and to optimize our supply chain network (the \"Conagra Restructuring Plan\"). Although we remain unable to make good faith estimates relating to the entire Conagra Restructuring Plan, we are reporting on actions initiated through the end of fiscal 2023 , including the estimated amounts or range of amounts for each major type of costs expected to be incurred, and the charges that have resulted or will result in cash outflows. As of May 28, 2023 , we had approved the incurrence of $ 186.4 million ($ 58.6 million of cash charges and $ 127.8 million of non-cash charges) for several projects associated with the Conagra Restructuring Plan. We have incurred or expect to incur $ 156.3 million of charges ($ 53.0 million of cash charges and $ 103.3 million of non-cash charges) for actions identified to date under the Conagra Restructuring Plan. We recognized charges of $ 10.7 million, $ 29.4 million, and $ 46.2 million in connection with the Conagra Restructuring Plan in fiscal 2023, 2022, and 2021 , respectively. We expect to incur costs related to the Conagra Restructuring Plan over a multi-year period.\\xa0Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements Fiscal Years Ended May 28, 2023, May 29, 2022, and May 30,

The proceeds were used to repay the full outstanding $ 250.0 million aggregate principal amount of our 3.25 % senior notes on their maturity date of September 15, 2022, as well as to repay outstanding borrowings under our commercial paper program. Borrowings under the Term Loan Agreement bear interest at the sum of Term SOFR (as defined in the Term Loan Agreement), plus a 0.10 % per annum rate spread adjustment, plus a percentage spread (ranging from 0.90 % per annum to 1.375 % per annum) based on the Company\\'s senior unsecured long-term indebtedness ratings. The Company may voluntarily prepay term loans under the Term Loan Agreement, in whole or in part, without premium or penalty, subject to certain conditions.\\xa0In the first quarter of fiscal 2022, we issued $ 500.0 million aggregate principal amount of 0.500 % senior notes due August 11, 2023. In the fourth quarter of fiscal 2021, we repaid the remaining outstanding $ 195.9 million aggregate principal amount of our 9.75 % subordinated notes on the maturity date of March 1, 2021.

In the second quarter of fiscal 2021, we issued $ 1.0 billion aggregate principal amount of 1.375 % senior notes due November 1, 2027 ( the \"2027 Senior Notes\"). We also redeemed the entire outstanding $ 1.20 billion aggregate principal amount of our 3.80 % senior notes prior to their maturity date of October 22, 2021, resulting in a net loss of $ 44.3 million within SG&A expenses as a cost of early extinguishment of debt. This redemption was primarily funded using the net proceeds from the issuance of the 2027 Senior Notes. \\xa0In the second quarter of fiscal 2021, we also repaid the entire outstanding $ 500.0 million aggregate principal amount of our floating rate notes on the maturity date of October 9, 2020. \\xa0In the first quarter of fiscal 2021, we repaid the remaining outstanding $ 126.6 million aggregate principal amount of our 4.95 % senior notes on their maturity date of August 15, 2020. \\xa0Net interest expense consists of:\\xa0 \\xa0 \\xa0 2023 \\xa0 \\xa0 2022 \\xa0 \\xa0 2021 \\xa0 Long-term debt\\xa0 $ 402.1 \\xa0 \\xa0 $ 393.1 \\xa0 \\xa0 $ 430.0 \\xa0 Short-term debt\\xa0 \\xa0 18.8 \\xa0 \\xa0 \\xa0 2.3 \\xa0 \\xa0 \\xa0 2.5 \\xa0 Interest income\\xa0 \\xa0 ( 3.9 ) \\xa0 \\xa0 ( 2.1 ) \\xa0 \\xa0 ( 1.9 ) Interest capitalized\\xa0 \\xa0 ( 7.4 ) \\xa0 \\xa0 ( 13.4 ) \\xa0 \\xa0 ( 10.2 ) \\xa0 \\xa0 $ 409.6 \\xa0 \\xa0 $ 379.9 \\xa0 \\xa0 $ 420.4 \\xa0  \\xa0', 'In the first quarter of fiscal 2019, we entered into deal-contingent forward starting interest rate swap contracts to hedge a portion of the interest rate risk related to our anticipated issuance of long-term debt to help finance the Pinnacle acquisition. During the second quarter of fiscal 2019, we terminated the interest rate swap contracts and received proceeds of $ 47.5 million. This gain was deferred in accumulated other comprehensive income and is being amortized as a reduction of interest expense over the lives of the related debt instruments. Our net interest expense was reduced by $ 3.4 million, $ 3.3 million, and $ 3.3 million in fiscal 2023, 2022, and 2021 , respectively, due to the impact of these interest rate swap contracts.', '\\xa0Interest paid was $ 416.3 million, $ 393.9 million, and $ 445.6 million in fiscal 2023, 2022, and 2021 , respectively.\\xa04. CREDIT FACILITIES AND BORROWINGS \\xa0In the first quarter of fiscal 2023, we entered into a Second Amended and Restated Revolving Credit Agreement (the \"Revolving Credit Agreement\") with a syndicate of financial institutions providing for a revolving credit facility in a maximum aggregate principal amount outstanding at any one time of $ 2.0 billion (subject to increase to a maximum aggregate principal amount of $ 2.5 billion with the consent of the lenders). The revolving credit facility provided for under the Revolving Credit Agreement replaced the Company\\'s revolving credit facility under the prior revolving credit agreement, which was terminated. The Revolving Credit Agreement matures on August 26, 2027 and is unsecured. The term of the Revolving Credit Agreement may be extended for additional one -year or two -year periods from the then-applicable maturity date on an annual basis. As of May 28, 2023 , there were no outstanding borrowings under the Revolving Credit Agreement.\\xa0The Revolving Credit Agreement contains events of default customary for unsecured investment grade credit facilities with corresponding grace periods. The Revolving Credit Agreement generally requires our ratio of earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation, and amortization (\"EBITDA\") to interest expense not to be less than 3.0 to 1.0 and our ratio of funded debt to EBITDA not to exceed 4.5 to 1.0, with each ratio to be calculated on a rolling four -quarter basis. As of May 28, 2023 , we were in compliance with all financial covenants under the Revolving Credit Agreement.\\xa0We finance our short-term liquidity needs with existing cash balances, cash flows from operations, and commercial paper borrowings. As of May 28, 2023 , we had $ 576.0 million outstanding under our commercial paper program at an average weighted interest rate of 5.70 %. As of May 29, 2022 , we had $ 180.0 million outstanding under our commercial paper program at an average weighted interest rate of 1.41 %.\\xa0We enter into various supplier financing arrangements to facilitate supply from our vendors. Balance sheet classification is based on the nature of the arrangement and amounts are classified as either Accounts payable or Notes payable within our Consolidated Balance Sheets. We have concluded that certain obligations to our suppliers, including amounts due and scheduled payment terms, are impacted by third -party service programs and therefore we have classified certain amounts outstanding under these programs as Notes payable. We had approximately $ 62.5 million of short-term borrowings as of May 28, 2023 related to these arrangements.\\xa0Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements Fiscal Years Ended May 28, 2023, May 29, 2022, and May 30, 2021 (columnar dollars in millions except per share amounts) \\xa0 5. DIVESTITURES AND ASSETS HELD FOR SALE \\xa0Divestitures \\xa0During the fourth quarter of fiscal 2021, we completed the sale of our Egg Beaters ® business for net proceeds of $ 50.7 million. The business results were previously reported primarily within our Refrigerated & Frozen segment, and to a lesser extent within our International and Foodservice segments. We recognized a gain on the sale of $ 10.4 million, included within SG&A expenses. In connection with the sale of our Egg Beaters ® business, we also recognized a loss of $ 7.1 million within SG&A expenses related to the early exit of an unfavorable contract.\\xa0During the third quarter of fiscal 2021, we completed the sale of our Peter Pan ® peanut butter business for net proceeds of $ 101.5 million. The business results were previously reported primarily within our Grocery & Snacks segment, and to a lesser extent within our International and Foodservice segments. We recognized a gain on the sale of $ 49.8 million, included within SG&A expenses.\\xa0During the second quarter of fiscal 2021, we completed the sale of our H.K. Anderson ® business for net proceeds of $ 8.7 million. The business results were previously reported in our Grocery & Snacks segment, and to a lesser extent within our Foodservice segment. We recognized a gain on the sale of $ 5.3 million, included within SG&A expenses.\\xa0Other Assets Held for Sale \\xa0During the second quarter of fiscal 2022, we initiated a plan to sell businesses with operating results included within our Grocery & Snacks, Refrigerated & Frozen, and Foodservice segments. In connection with this activity, we recognized impairment charges of $ 70.1 million and $ 26.7 million within SG&A expenses in fiscal 2022 and 2023, respectively. During the second quarter of fiscal 2023, it was determined that these assets and liabilities previously presented as assets and liabilities held for sale within our Consolidated Balance Sheets no longer met the held for sale criteria. Assets of $ 58.9 million and liabilities of $ 4.1 million as of May 29, 2022 have been reclassified to assets and liabilities held and used.\\xa0Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements Fiscal Years Ended May 28, 2023, May 29, 2022, and May 30, 2021 (columnar dollars in millions except per share amounts) \\xa0 6. INVESTMENTS IN JOINT VENTURES \\xa0The total carrying value of our equity method investments at the end of fiscal 2023 and 2022 was $ 998.4 million and $ 918.3 million, respectively. These amounts are included in other assets and reflect our 44 % ownership interest in Ardent Mills and a 50 % ownership interest in one other joint venture. Due to differences in fiscal reporting periods, we recognized the equity method investment earnings on a lag of approximately one month.\\xa0In fiscal 2023 , we had purchases from our equity method investees of $ 30.8 million. Total dividends received from equity method investments in fiscal 2023 were $ 138.4 million.\\xa0In fiscal 2022 , we had purchases from our equity method investees of $ 30.1 million. Total dividends received from equity method investments in fiscal 2022 were $ 79.0 million.\\xa0In fiscal 2021 , we had purchases from our equity method investees of $ 28.7 million.

The change in management reporting required us to reassign assets and liabilities, including goodwill, between the reporting units, complete a goodwill impairment test both prior to and subsequent to the change, and evaluate other assets in the reporting units for impairment, including indefinite-lived intangibles (brand names and trademarks). The fair value of our reporting units is estimated using a discounted cash flow analysis and the fair value of our indefinite-lived intangibles are determined using the \"relief from royalty\" methodology. \\xa0Both the \"relief from royalty\" methodology used to value our indefinite-lived intangible assets and the discounted cash flow analysis require us to estimate the future cash flows as well as to select a risk-adjusted discount rate to measure the present value of the anticipated cash flows. When determining future cash flow estimates, we consider historical results adjusted to reflect current and anticipated operating conditions. We estimate cash flows for a reporting unit over a discrete period (typically five years) and a terminal period (considering expected long-term growth rates and trends). Estimating the fair value of individual reporting units and our indefinite-lived intangible assets requires us to make assumptions and estimates in areas such as future economic conditions, industry-specific conditions, product pricing, and necessary capital expenditures. The use of different assumptions or estimates for future cash flows, discount rates, or terminal growth rates could produce substantially different estimates of the fair value.\\xa0We used a discount rate of 7.75 % and a terminal growth rate that approximated 1 % in estimating the fair value of our Sides, Components, Enhancers reporting unit during our impairment testing in the first quarter of fiscal 2023. As a result of our impairment tests, we recognized goodwill impairment charges within SG&A expenses of $ 141.7 million within our Sides, Components, Enhancers reporting unit. In addition, we recognized an impairment charge within SG&A expenses of $ 244.0 million related to our Birds Eye ® brand name in the first quarter of fiscal 2023. The impairments were largely due to the 125 basis point increase in the discount rate as a result of current economic conditions, including a significant increase in interest rates since our last quantitative impairment tests, as well as a downward revision to our sales forecasts. \\xa0In the fourth quarter of fiscal 2023 , we performed our annual goodwill impairment assessment on all of our reporting units and found no indicators of impairment. We completed a qualitative assessment on all of our reporting units with the exception of our Foodservice and Sides, Components, Enhancers reporting units. Our qualitative assessment considered, among other things, an increase in our market capitalization from our previous testing date, continued sales growth, and improvement in our operating margins which all had a positive impact on our financial results. We will continue to evaluate the impact of any significant changes in consumer purchasing behaviors, government restrictions, input cost inflation, or other macroeconomic conditions that could change certain assumptions and result in future impairments. We completed a quantitative impairment test for our Foodservice and Sides, Components, Enhancers reporting units. We used a discount rate of 7.75 % and a terminal growth rate that approximated 1 % in estimating the fair value of both of these reporting units. Based upon our quantitative impairment tests, the excess fair value over the carrying value for our Foodservice reporting unit was greater than 30%. The excess fair value over the carrying value for our Sides, Components, Enhancers reporting unit was less than 10%, and fair value remained relatively consistent to our quantitative impairment test performed in the first quarter of fiscal 2023. \\xa0Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements Fiscal Years Ended May 28, 2023, May 29, 2022, and May 30, 2021 (columnar dollars in millions except per share amounts) \\xa0 Amortizing intangible assets, carrying a remaining weighted-average life of approximately 18 years, are principally composed of customer relationships and acquired intellectual property. For fiscal 2023, 2022, and 2021 , we recognized amortization expense of $ 56.8 million, $ 59.3 million, and $ 59.7 million, respectively. Based on amortizing assets recognized in our Consolidated Balance Sheet as of May 28, 2023 , amortization expense for the next five years is estimated to be as follows:\\xa0 2024\\xa0 $ 53.6 \\xa0 2025\\xa0 \\xa0 53.5 \\xa0 2026\\xa0 \\xa0 43.5 \\xa0 2027\\xa0 \\xa0 43.3 \\xa0 2028\\xa0 \\xa0 40.8 \\xa0  \\xa0For our non-amortizing intangible assets, which are comprised of brands and trademarks, we use a \"relief from royalty\" methodology in estimating fair value. In the fourth quarter of fiscal 2023, as a result of our annual impairment test for indefinite lived intangibles, we recognized impairment charges in SG&A expenses of $ 345.2 million, primarily within our Grocery & Snacks and Refrigerated & Frozen segments. The most notable brands with impairments included Gardein ®, Birds Eye®, Hungry Man®, Vlasic®, Van De Kamps®, Earth Balance®, and Comstock®. These brands were negatively impacted by an increase in our discount rate in response to the current economic environment (including an increase in interest rates) since our last annual impairment test. Our two largest impairments were related to Gardein ® and Birds Eye ® in the amount of $ 91.5 million and $ 78.3 million, respectively. Both of these brands were negatively impacted by lower than expected profit margins which resulted in a reduction to our assumed royalty rates in addition to revised sales growth expectations to be consistent with recent industry trends. Including the Birds Eye ® brand impairment recognized in the first quarter of fiscal 2023, discussed above, our total brand impairment charges recognized in fiscal 2023 were $ 589.2 million.\\xa0During fiscal 2022, as a result of our annual impairment test for indefinite lived intangibles, we recognized impairment charges in SG&A expenses of $ 209.0 million, primarily within our Grocery & Snacks and Refrigerated & Frozen segments. Duncan Hines ® and Gardein ® were the most notable brands with impairments largely due to lower than expected profit margins which resulted in a reduction to our assumed royalty rates along with increases in our discount rate.\\xa0During fiscal 2021 , as a result of our annual impairment test for indefinite lived intangibles, we recognized impairment charges in SG&A expenses of $ 90.9 million, primarily within our Grocery & Snacks and Refrigerated & Frozen segments. Udi ’ s ® was the most notable brand with impairment in fiscal 2021 largely due to lower than expected sales and profit margins which resulted in a reduction to our assumed royalty rate.\\xa08. EARNINGS PER SHARE \\xa0Basic earnings per share is calculated on the basis of weighted average outstanding shares of common stock. Diluted earnings per share is computed on the basis of basic weighted average outstanding shares of common stock adjusted for the dilutive effect of stock options, restricted stock unit awards, and other dilutive securities.\\xa0The following table reconciles the income and average share amounts used to compute both basic and diluted earnings per share:\\xa0 \\xa0 \\xa0 2023 \\xa0 \\xa0 2022 \\xa0 \\xa0 2021 \\xa0 Net income attributable to Conagra Brands, Inc. common stockholders:\\xa0 $ 683.6 \\xa0 \\xa0 $ 888.2 \\xa0 \\xa0 $ 1,298.8 \\xa0 Weighted average shares outstanding: \\xa0 \\xa0 \\xa0 \\xa0 \\xa0 \\xa0 \\xa0 \\xa0 \\xa0 \\xa0 \\xa0 \\xa0 Basic weighted average shares outstanding\\xa0 \\xa0 478.9 \\xa0 \\xa0 \\xa0 480.3 \\xa0 \\xa0 \\xa0 485.8 \\xa0 Add: Dilutive effect of stock options, restricted stock unit awards, and other dilutive securities\\xa0 \\xa0 1.8 \\xa0 \\xa0 \\xa0 1.9 \\xa0 \\xa0 \\xa0 2.0 \\xa0 Diluted weighted average shares outstanding\\xa0 \\xa0 480.7 \\xa0 \\xa0 \\xa0 482.2 \\xa0 \\xa0 \\xa0 487.8 \\xa0  \\xa0For fiscal 2023, 2022, and 2021 , there were 0.5 million , 0.8 million, and 0.4 million stock options outstanding, respectively, that were excluded from the computation of diluted weighted average shares because the effect was antidilutive.\\xa0Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements Fiscal Years Ended May 28, 2023, May 29, 2022, and May 30, 2021 (columnar dollars in millions except per share amounts) \\xa0 9.

There were no preferred shares issued or outstanding as of May 28, 2023 .\\xa0We have repurchased our shares of common stock from time to time after considering market conditions and in accordance with repurchase limits authorized by our Board. We repurchased 4.2 million shares of our common stock for approximately $ 150.0 million in fiscal 2023, 1.5 million shares of our common stock for approximately $ 50.0 million in fiscal 2022, and 8.8 million shares of our common stock for approximately $ 298.1 million in fiscal 2021. \\xa012. SHARE-BASED PAYMENTS \\xa0In accordance with stockholder-approved equity incentive plans, we grant stock-based compensation awards, including restricted stock units, performance shares, performance-based restricted stock units, and stock options. The shares delivered upon vesting or lapse of restriction under any such arrangement may consist, in whole or part, of treasury stock or authorized but unissued stock, not reserved for any other purpose.\\xa0On September 19, 2014, our stockholders approved the Conagra Brands, Inc. 2014 Stock Plan (as amended effective December 11, 2017, the \"Plan\"). The Plan authorizes the issuance of up to 40.3 million shares of Conagra Brands common stock. In addition to the shares under the 2014 Stock Plan, certain shares of Conagra Brands common stock subject to outstanding awards under predecessor stock plans that expire, lapse, are cancelled, terminated, forfeited, otherwise become unexercisable, or are settled for cash are available for issuance. At May 28, 2023 , approximately 37.4 million shares were reserved for granting new share-based awards.\\xa0Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements Fiscal Years Ended May 28, 2023, May 29, 2022, and May 30, 2021 (columnar dollars in millions except per share amounts) \\xa0 Share Unit Awards \\xa0In accordance with stockholder-approved equity incentive plans, we grant awards of restricted stock units (\"share units\") to employees and directors. These awards generally have requisite service periods of three years. Under each such award, stock is issued without direct cost to the employee. We estimate the fair value of the share units based upon the market price of our stock at the date of grant. Certain share unit grants do not provide for the payment of dividend equivalents to the participant during the requisite service period (the \"vesting period\"). For those grants, the value of the grants is reduced by the net present value of the foregone dividend equivalent payments.\\xa0We recognize compensation expense for share unit awards on a straight-line basis over the requisite service period, accounting for forfeitures as they occur. The compensation expense for our stock-settled share unit awards totaled $ 34.2 million, $ 25.8 million, and $ 28.1 million for fiscal 2023, 2022, and 2021 , respectively. The tax benefit related to the stock-settled share unit award compensation expense for fiscal 2023, 2022, and 2021 was $ 6.2 million , $ 5.3 million, and $ 6.1 million, respectively. \\xa0The following table summarizes the nonvested share units as of May 28, 2023 and changes during the fiscal year then ended:\\xa0 \\xa0 \\xa0 Stock-Settled \\xa0 Share Units \\xa0 Share Units (in Millions) \\xa0 \\xa0 Weighted Average Grant-Date Fair Value \\xa0 Nonvested share units at May 29, 2022\\xa0 \\xa0 2.50 \\xa0 \\xa0 $ 32.94 \\xa0 Granted\\xa0 \\xa0 1.56 \\xa0 \\xa0 $ 33.28 \\xa0 Vested/Issued\\xa0 \\xa0 ( 1.02 ) \\xa0 $ 29.61 \\xa0 Forfeited\\xa0 \\xa0 ( 0.21 ) \\xa0 $ 34.23 \\xa0 Nonvested share units at May 28, 2023\\xa0 \\xa0 2.83 \\xa0 \\xa0 $ 34.23 \\xa0  \\xa0During fiscal 2023, 2022, and 2021 , we granted 1.6 million , 1.1 million, and 0.9 million stock-settled share units, respectively, with a weighted average grant date fair value of $ 33.28 , $ 34.26 , and $ 36.72 per share unit, respectively. \\xa0The total intrinsic value of stock-settled share units vested was $ 34.7 million , $ 26.9 million, and $ 24.6 million during fiscal 2023, 2022, and 2021 , respectively.

The performance goal for one - third of the target number of performance shares for the three -year performance period ended in fiscal 2023 (the \"2023 performance period\") was based on our fiscal 2021 diluted earnings per share (\"EPS\") compound annual growth rate (\"CAGR\"), subject to certain adjustments. The performance goal for the final two -thirds of the target number of performance shares granted for the 2023 performance period was based on our diluted EPS CAGR, subject to certain adjustments, measured over the two -year period ended in fiscal 2023. The performance goal for the three -year performance period ending in fiscal 2024 (the \"2024 performance period\") is based on our diluted EPS CAGR, subject to certain adjustments, measured over the defined performance period. The performance goals for the three -year performance period ending in fiscal 2025 (the \"2025 performance period\") are based on our net sales and diluted EPS growth, subject to certain adjustments, measured over the defined performance period, with each year of the performance period weighted one -third. For each of the 2023 performance period, 2024 performance period, and 2025 performance period, the awards actually earned will range from zero to two hundred percent of the targeted number of performance shares for such performance period. Dividend equivalents are paid on the portion of performance shares actually earned at our regular dividend rate in additional shares of common stock.\\xa0Awards, if earned, will be paid in shares of our common stock. Subject to limited exceptions set forth in our performance share plan, any shares earned will be distributed after the end of the performance period, and generally only if the participant continues to be employed with the Company through the date of distribution. For awards where performance against the performance target has not been certified, the value of the performance shares is adjusted based upon the market price of our common stock and current forecasted performance against the performance targets at the end of each reporting period and amortized as compensation expense over the vesting period. Forfeitures are accounted for as they occur.\\xa0\\xa0Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements Fiscal Years Ended May 28, 2023, May 29, 2022, and May 30, 2021 (columnar dollars in millions except per share amounts) \\xa0 A summary of the activity for performance share awards as of May 28, 2023 and changes during the fiscal year then ended is presented below:\\xa0 Performance Shares \\xa0 Share Units (in Millions) \\xa0 \\xa0 Weighted Average Grant-Date Fair Value \\xa0 Nonvested performance shares at May 29, 2022\\xa0 \\xa0 1.44 \\xa0 \\xa0 $ 32.80 \\xa0 Granted\\xa0 \\xa0 0.74 \\xa0 \\xa0 $ 33.13 \\xa0 Adjustments for performance results attained and dividend equivalents\\xa0 \\xa0 ( 0.54 ) \\xa0 $ 28.45 \\xa0 Forfeited\\xa0 \\xa0 ( 0.07 ) \\xa0 $ 34.18 \\xa0 Nonvested performance shares at May 28, 2023\\xa0 \\xa0 1.57 \\xa0 \\xa0 $ 34.39 \\xa0  \\xa0We recognized expense of $ 45.0 million, a benefit of $ 1.4 million, and expense of $ 34.9 million for our performance share awards in fiscal 2023, 2022, and 2021 , respectively. The tax expense related to the compensation benefit for fiscal 2022 was $ 0.7 million. The tax benefit related to the compensation expense for fiscal 2023 and 2021 was $ 1.7 million and $ 3.6 million, respectively.\\xa0The total intrinsic value of performance shares vested (including shares paid in lieu of dividends) during fiscal 2022 and 2021 was $ 27.0 million and $ 33.9 million, respectively. Performance targets for the three -year performance period ending in fiscal 2022 were not met, resulting in no vesting during fiscal 2023. \\xa0Based on estimates at May 28, 2023 , we had $ 17.0 million of total unrecognized compensation expense related to performance shares that will be recognized over a weighted average period of 1.7 years .\\xa0Performance-Based Restricted Stock Unit Awards \\xa0On April 15, 2019 (the \"grant date\"), we made grants of performance-based restricted stock unit (\"PBRSU\") awards to the Company\\'s named executive officers and a limited group of other senior officers of the Company. The compensation expense for our PBRSU awards totaled $ 1.7 million and $ 2.4 million for fiscal 2022 and 2021, respectively. The tax expense (benefit) related to our PBRSU awards for fiscal 2022 and 2021was $ 0.4 million and $( 0.2 ) million, respectively. As of May 27, 2022, the end of the PBRSU performance period, the awards did not achieve the absolute TSR goals and resulted in a 0 % payout.\\xa0Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements Fiscal Years Ended May 28, 2023, May 29, 2022, and May 30, 2021 (columnar dollars in millions except per share amounts) \\xa0 Stock Option Awards \\xa0In accordance with stockholder-approved equity incentive plans, we granted stock options to employees and directors for the purchase of common stock at prices equal to its fair value at the date of grant. Stock options become exercisable under various vesting schedules (typically three years) and generally expire seven to ten years after the date of grant. No stock options were granted in fiscal 2023 , 2022 , or 2021 .\\xa0A summary of the option activity as of May 28, 2023 and changes during the fiscal year then ended is presented below:\\xa0 Options \\xa0 Number of Options (in Millions) \\xa0 \\xa0 Weighted Average Exercise Price \\xa0 \\xa0 Average Remaining Contractual Term (Years) \\xa0 \\xa0 Aggregate Intrinsic Value (in Millions) \\xa0 Outstanding at May 29, 2022\\xa0 \\xa0 2.7 \\xa0 \\xa0 $ 30.87 \\xa0 \\xa0 \\xa0 \\xa0 \\xa0 \\xa0 \\xa0 \\xa0 \\xa0 Exercised\\xa0 \\xa0 ( 0.3 ) \\xa0 $ 29.95 \\xa0 \\xa0 \\xa0 \\xa0 \\xa0 \\xa0 $ 2.9 \\xa0 Expired\\xa0 \\xa0 ( 0.1 ) \\xa0 $ 35.81 \\xa0 \\xa0 \\xa0 \\xa0 \\xa0 \\xa0 \\xa0 \\xa0 \\xa0 Outstanding at May 28, 2023\\xa0 \\xa0 2.3 \\xa0 \\xa0 $ 30.86 \\xa0 \\xa0 \\xa0 2.31 \\xa0 \\xa0 $ 9.8 \\xa0 Exercisable at May 28, 2023\\xa0 \\xa0 2.3 \\xa0 \\xa0 $ 30.86 \\xa0 \\xa0 \\xa0 2.31 \\xa0 \\xa0 $ 9.8 \\xa0  \\xa0We recognized compensation expense using the straight-line method over the requisite service period, accounting for forfeitures as they occurred.

millions except per share amounts) \\xa0 The liability for gross unrecognized tax benefits at May 28, 2023 was $ 23.7 million, excluding a related liability of $ 5.6 million for gross interest and penalties. As of May 29, 2022 , our gross liability for unrecognized tax benefits was $ 62.9 million, excluding a related liability of $ 6.7 million for gross interest and penalties. Interest and penalties recognized in the Consolidated Statements of Earnings was a benefit of $ 1.2 million and $ 2.1 million in fiscal 2023 and 2022 , respectively, and an expense of $ 1.4 million in fiscal 2021. \\xa0The net amount of unrecognized tax benefits at May 28, 2023 and May 29, 2022 that, if recognized, would favorably impact our effective tax rate was $ 21.3 million and $ 58.0 million, respectively.\\xa0We accrue interest and penalties associated with uncertain tax positions as part of income tax expense.\\xa0', 'We conduct business and file tax returns in numerous countries, states, and local jurisdictions. The U.S. Internal Revenue Service (\"IRS\") has completed its audit of the Company for tax years through fiscal 2020. All resulting significant items for fiscal 2020 and prior years have been settled with the IRS. Tax elections made in conjunction with filing our fiscal 2021 federal tax return are still under review with the IRS. Statutes of limitation for pre-acquisition tax years of Pinnacle generally remain open for calendar year 2003 and subsequent years principally related to net operating losses. Other major jurisdictions where we conduct business generally have statutes of limitations ranging from three to five years.', '\\xa0We estimate that it is reasonably possible that the amount of gross unrecognized tax benefits will decrease by up to $ 4.0 million over the next twelve months due to various federal, state, and foreign audit settlements and the expiration of statutes of limitations.\\xa0The change in the unrecognized tax benefits for the fiscal years ended May 28, 2023 and May 29, 2022 was as follows:\\xa0 \\xa0\\xa0 \\xa0 May 28, 2023 \\xa0 \\xa0 \\xa0 May 29, 2022 \\xa0 Beginning balance\\xa0 $ 62.9 \\xa0 \\xa0 $ 33.0 \\xa0 Increases from positions established during prior periods\\xa0 \\xa0 0.3 \\xa0 \\xa0 \\xa0 13.2 \\xa0 Decreases from positions established during prior periods\\xa0 \\xa0 ( 32.3 ) \\xa0 \\xa0 ( 3.2 ) Increases from positions established during the current period\\xa0 \\xa0 1.7 \\xa0 \\xa0 \\xa0 31.7 \\xa0 Reductions resulting from lapse of applicable statute of limitation\\xa0 \\xa0 ( 8.9 ) \\xa0 \\xa0 ( 3.1 ) Decrease from audit settlements\\xa0 \\xa0 ( 0.1 ) \\xa0 \\xa0 ( 8.5 ) Other adjustments to liability\\xa0 \\xa0 0.1 \\xa0 \\xa0 \\xa0 ( 0.2 ) Ending balance\\xa0 $ 23.7 \\xa0 \\xa0 $ 62.9 \\xa0  \\xa0We have approximately $ 11.8 million of foreign net operating loss carryforwards ($ 11.5 million will expire between fiscal 2028 and 2043 and $ 0.3 million have no expiration dates) and $ 69.2 million of federal net operating loss carryforwards which expire between fiscal 2024 and 2027. Included in net deferred tax liabilities are $ 18.3 million of tax effected state net operating loss carryforwards which expire in various years ranging from fiscal 2024 to 2043 and $ 2.1 million of tax effected state capital loss balances that expire in fiscal year 2027 through 2037. Foreign tax credits of $ 9.1 million will expire between fiscal 2025 and 2033. State tax credits of approximately $ 4.0 million will expire in various years ranging from fiscal 2024 to 2030. \\xa0In fiscal 2022, we reflected additional tax expense of $ 25.0 million related to tax elections made in conjunction with filing our fiscal 2021 federal tax return. These elections are still under review with the IRS. These elections may result in increases to the tax basis in those assets and if successful would result in tax benefits being realized in future periods.\\xa0We have recognized a valuation allowance for the portion of the net operating loss carryforwards, capital loss carryforwards, tax credit carryforwards, and other deferred tax assets we believe are not more likely than not to be realized. The net change in the valuation allowance for fiscal 2023 was an increase of $ 2.1 million. During fiscal 2023, we concluded that certain tax elections made by a subsidiary had a confidence level of more-likely-than- not which allowed us to release a valuation allowance of $ 28.1 million. Additionally, a valuation allowance increased by $ 30.1 million for an item that was previously reserved as an uncertain tax position. For fiscal 2022 , the change in the valuation allowance was an increase of $ 388.0 million, which principally relates to valuation allowances on increases in tax basis from tax elections made on our fiscal 2021 federal tax return that are still under review with the IRS.\\xa0Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements Fiscal Years Ended May 28, 2023, May 29, 2022, and May 30, 2021 (columnar dollars in millions except per share amounts) \\xa0 In the prior year, we made the assessment that the current earnings of certain foreign subsidiaries were not indefinitely reinvested or that we could not remit to the U.S. parent in a tax-neutral transaction. Accordingly, we have recorded a deferred tax liability of $ 6.2 million on approximately $ 123.4 million of earnings at May 28, 2023. The deferred tax liability relates to local withholding taxes that will be owed when this cash is distributed. The undistributed historic earnings in our foreign subsidiaries through May 30, 2021 are considered to be indefinitely reinvested or can be remitted in a tax-neutral transaction. Accordingly, we have not recorded a deferred tax liability related to these undistributed historic earnings.\\xa0On August 16, 2022, the Inflation Reduction Act of 2022 was signed into law. We continue to evaluate the impact of the recently enacted law, including whether we are subject to the corporate alternative minimum tax. However, we do not expect the impact to be material to our Consolidated Financial Statements.14. LEASES \\xa0We have operating and finance leases of certain warehouses, plants, land, office space, production and distribution equipment, automobiles, and office equipment. We determine whether an agreement is or contains a lease at lease inception. Right-of-use (\"ROU\") assets represent our right to use an underlying asset for the lease term and lease liabilities represent our obligation to make lease payments arising from the lease.\\xa0As most of our leases do not provide an implicit interest rate, we calculate the lease liability at lease commencement as the present value of unpaid lease payments using our estimated incremental borrowing rate. The incremental borrowing rate represents the rate of interest that we would have to pay to borrow an amount equal to the lease payments on a collateralized basis over a similar term and is determined using a portfolio approach based on information available at the commencement date of the lease.\\xa0We have elected not to separate lease and non-lease components of an agreement for all underlying asset classes prospectively from the ASU 2016 - 02, Leases, Topic 842 adoption date.\\xa0Any lease arrangements with an initial term of twelve months or less are not recorded on our Consolidated Balance Sheet. We recognize lease cost for these lease arrangements on a straight-line basis over the lease term.\\xa0Our lease terms may include options to extend or terminate the lease.

CONTINGENCIES \\xa0Litigation Matters \\xa0', 'We are a party to certain litigation matters relating to our acquisition of Beatrice Company (\"Beatrice\") in fiscal 1991, including litigation proceedings related to businesses divested by Beatrice prior to our acquisition. These proceedings have included suits against a number of lead-based paint and pigment manufacturers, including ConAgra Grocery Products Company, LLC, a wholly owned subsidiary of the Company (\"ConAgra Grocery Products\"), as alleged successor to W. P. Fuller & Co., a lead-based paint and pigment manufacturer owned and operated by a predecessor to Beatrice from 1962 until 1967. These lawsuits have generally sought damages for personal injury, property damage, economic loss, and governmental expenditures allegedly caused by the use of lead-based paint, and/or injunctive relief for inspection and abatement. When such lawsuits have been brought, ConAgra Grocery Products has denied liability, both on the merits of the claims and on the basis that we do not believe it to be the successor to any liability attributable to W. P. Fuller & Co. In the first half of fiscal 2023, we obtained a final judgment in our favor in one such lawsuit that had been brought in Illinois. Pursuant to the settlement of a consolidated lead-based paint and pigment related action in California in 2019, ConAgra Grocery Products is responsible for payments totaling $ 101.7 million, payable in seven annual installments from fiscal 2020 through fiscal 2026, of which $ 61.0 million had been paid as of May 28, 2023. As part of the settlement, ConAgra Grocery Products has also provided a guarantee of up to $ 15.0 million in the event co-defendant, NL Industries, Inc., defaults on its payment obligations. We had accrued $ 11.8 million and $ 28.9 million, within other accrued liabilities and other noncurrent liabilities, respectively, for this matter as of May 28, 2023. ', '\\xa0We are party to a number of putative class action lawsuits challenging various product claims made in the Company\\'s product labeling. In the first half of fiscal 2023, we settled one such claim, a class action lawsuit captioned, Briseno v. ConAgra Foods, Inc., et al , related to the labeling for Wesson ® oils as 100% natural, for $ 3.0 million. While we cannot predict with certainty the results of the remaining claims or any other legal proceedings, we do not expect these matters to have a material adverse effect on our financial condition, results of operations, or business.\\xa0In the first quarter of fiscal 2023, a consolidated shareholder derivative lawsuit against our executive officers alleging violations of the federal securities laws in 2018 captioned Klein v. Arora, et al. , was dismissed and the lawsuit was terminated . \\xa0We are party to matters challenging the Company\\'s wage and hour practices. While we cannot predict with certainty the results of these or any other legal proceedings, we do not expect these matters to have a material adverse effect on our financial condition, results of operations, or business.\\xa0We are party to a number of matters asserting product liability claims against the Company related to certain Pam® and other cooking spray products. These lawsuits generally seek damages for personal injuries allegedly caused by defects in the design, manufacture, or safety warnings of the cooking spray products. We have put the Company\\'s insurance carriers on notice. While we cannot predict with certainty the results of these or any other legal proceedings, the Company believes adequate provision has been made in its consolidated financial statements for all probable and reasonably estimable losses for the litigation related to the cooking spray products based on information available to us at the time of our evaluation.\\xa0The Company reevaluates on a quarterly and annual basis its exposure from the litigation related to the cooking spray products, including studying its claims experience and considering numerous variables that can affect its liability exposure from the litigation related to the cooking spray products on an overall or per lawsuit basis. Based upon its regular reevaluation of its exposure from the litigation related to the cooking spray products, the Company has updated its liability analysis for the litigation related to the cooking spray products through May 28, 2023. Although it is reasonably possible that the amount of the loss ultimately incurred may be in excess of the amounts accrued in our financial statements, we do not expect these cooking spray product matters to have a material adverse effect on our financial condition, results of operations, or business.\\xa0Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements Fiscal Years Ended May 28, 2023, May 29, 2022, and May 30, 2021 (columnar dollars in millions except per share amounts) \\xa0 Environmental Matters \\xa0Securities and Exchange Commission (the \"SEC\") regulations require us to disclose certain information about environmental proceedings if a governmental authority is a party to such proceedings and such proceedings involve potential monetary sanctions that we reasonably believe will exceed a stated threshold. Pursuant to the SEC regulations, the Company uses a threshold of $ 1.0 million for purposes of determining whether disclosure of any such proceedings is required.\\xa0In October 2019, the Minnesota Pollution Control Agency (\"MPCA\") initiated an odor complaint investigation at our Waseca, Minnesota vegetable processing facility. As a result of the investigation, the MPCA required implementation of a continuous monitoring system running from May 1 to October 31 in 2020 and 2021 and from April 1 to October 31 in 2022 to monitor hydrogen sulfide emissions at the wastewater treatment facility. As a result of the monitoring data findings, the MPCA has alleged violations of Minnesota Ambient Air Quality Standards based on our hydrogen sulfide emissions during calendar years 2020, 2021, and 2022. While a settlement agreement has not been finalized, the parties have tentatively agreed upon a penalty amount of $ 1.25 million for all of the alleged violations.\\xa0', 'We are a party to certain environmental proceedings relating to businesses divested by Beatrice prior to our acquisition in fiscal 1991, including litigation and administrative proceedings involving Beatrice\\'s possible status as a potentially responsible party at approximately 35 Superfund, proposed Superfund, or state-equivalent sites (the \"Beatrice sites\"). The Beatrice sites consist of locations previously owned or operated by predecessors of Beatrice that used or produced petroleum, pesticides, fertilizers, dyes, inks, solvents, polychlorinated biphenyls, acids, lead, sulfur, tannery wastes, and/or other contaminants. Reserves for these Beatrice environmental proceedings have been established based on our best estimate of the undiscounted remediation liabilities, which estimates include evaluation of investigatory studies, extent of required clean-up, the known volumetric contribution of Beatrice and other potentially responsible parties, and its experience in remediating sites. The accrual for Beatrice-related environmental matters totaled $ 40.1 million ($ 1.5 million within other accrued liabilities and $ 38.6 million within other noncurrent liabilities) as of May 28, 2023 , a majority of which relates to the Superfund and state-equivalent sites referenced above.', '\\xa0Guarantees and Other Contingencies \\xa0In certain limited situations, we will guarantee an obligation of an unconsolidated entity. As of May 28, 2023, we continued to guarantee an obligation of the Lamb Weston business pursuant to a guarantee arrangement that existed prior to the spinoff of the Lamb Weston business (the \"Spinoff\"), remained in place following completion of the Spinoff, and will remain in place until such guarantee obligation is substituted for guarantees issued by Lamb Weston. Pursuant to the separation and distribution agreement, dated as of November 8, 2016 ( the \"Separation Agreement\"), between us and Lamb Weston, this guarantee arrangement is deemed a liability of Lamb Weston that was transferred to Lamb Weston as part of the Spinoff. Accordingly, under the Separation Agreement, in the event that we are required to make any payments as a result of this guarantee arrangement, Lamb Weston is obligated to indemnify us for any such liability, reduced by any insurance proceeds received by us. Lamb Weston is a party to an agricultural sublease agreement with a third party for certain farmland through 2025 (subject, at Lamb Weston\\'s option, to extension for one additional five -year period). Under the terms of the sublease agreement, Lamb Weston is required to make certain rental payments to the sublessor. We have guaranteed to the sublessor Lamb Weston\\'s performance and the payment of all amounts (including indemnification obligations) owed by Lamb Weston under the sublease agreement, up to a maximum of $ 75.0 million. We believe the farmland associated with this sublease agreement is readily marketable for lease to other area farming operators. As such, we believe that any financial exposure to the Company, in the event that we were required to perform under the guarantee, would be largely mitigated.\\xa0Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements Fiscal Years Ended May 28, 2023, May 29, 2022, and May 30, 2021 (columnar dollars in millions except per share amounts) \\xa0 We also guarantee a lease resulting from an exited facility. As of May 28, 2023 , the remaining term of this arrangement did not exceed four years and the maximum amount of future payments we have guaranteed was $ 8.7 million.\\xa0General \\xa0After taking into account liabilities recognized for all of the foregoing matters, management believes the ultimate resolution of such matters should not have a material adverse effect on our financial condition, results of operations, or liquidity; however, it is reasonably possible that a change of the estimates of any of the foregoing matters may occur in the future that could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition, results of operations, or liquidity.\\xa0Costs of legal services associated with the foregoing matters are recognized within SG&A expenses as services are provided.\\xa016. DERIVATIVE FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS \\xa0Our operations are exposed to market risks from adverse changes in commodity prices affecting the cost of raw materials and energy, foreign currency exchange rates, and interest rates. In the normal course of business, these risks are managed through a variety of strategies, including the use of derivatives.\\xa0Commodity futures and option contracts are used from time to time to economically hedge commodity input prices on items such as natural gas, vegetable oils, proteins, packaging materials, dairy, grains, diesel fuel and electricity. Generally, we economically hedge a portion of our anticipated consumption of commodity inputs for periods of up to 36 months. We may enter into longer-term economic hedges on particular commodities, if deemed appropriate. As of May 28, 2023 , we had economically hedged certain portions of our anticipated consumption of commodity inputs using derivative instruments with expiration dates through May 2024. \\xa0In order to reduce exposures related to changes in foreign currency exchange rates, we enter into forward exchange, option, or swap contracts from time to time for transactions denominated in a currency other than the applicable functional currency. This includes, but is not limited to, hedging against foreign currency risk in purchasing inventory and capital equipment, sales of finished goods, and future settlement of foreign-denominated assets and liabilities. As of May 28, 2023 , we had economically hedged certain portions of our foreign currency risk in anticipated transactions using derivative instruments with expiration dates through February 2024. \\xa0From time to time, we may use derivative instruments, including interest rate swaps, to reduce risk related to changes in interest rates. This includes, but is not limited to, hedging against increasing interest rates prior to the issuance of long-term debt and hedging the fair value of our senior long-term debt.\\xa0Derivatives Designated as Cash Flow Hedges \\xa0', 'During the first quarter of fiscal 2019, we entered into deal-contingent forward starting interest rate swap contracts to hedge a portion of the interest rate risk related to our issuance of long-term debt to help finance the acquisition of Pinnacle. We settled these contracts during the second quarter of fiscal 2019 and deferred a $ 47.5 million gain in accumulated other comprehensive income that is being amortized as a reduction of interest expense over the lives of the related debt instruments. In the second quarter of fiscal 2021, $ 0.5 million was written off in connection with the early extinguishment of debt (see Note 3 ). The unamortized amount at May 28, 2023 was $ 31.5 million.', '\\xa0Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements Fiscal Years Ended May 28, 2023, May 29, 2022, and May 30, 2021 (columnar dollars in millions except per share amounts) \\xa0 Economic Hedges of Forecasted Cash Flows \\xa0Many of our derivatives do not qualify for, and we do not currently designate certain commodity or foreign currency derivatives to achieve, hedge accounting treatment. We reflect realized and unrealized gains and losses from derivatives used to economically hedge anticipated commodity consumption and to mitigate foreign currency cash flow risk in earnings immediately within general corporate expense (within cost of goods sold). The gains and losses are reclassified to segment operating results in the period in which the underlying item being economically hedged is recognized in cost of goods sold. In the event that management determines a particular derivative entered into as an economic hedge of a forecasted commodity purchase has ceased to function as an economic hedge, we cease recognizing further gains and losses on such derivatives in corporate expense and begin recognizing such gains and losses within segment operating results immediately.\\xa0Economic Hedges of Fair Values — Foreign Currency Exchange Rate Risk \\xa0We may use options and cross currency swaps to economically hedge the fair value of certain monetary assets and liabilities (including intercompany balances) denominated in a currency other than the functional currency. These derivatives are marked-to-market with gains and losses immediately recognized in SG&A expenses. These substantially offset the foreign currency transaction gains or losses recognized as values of the monetary assets or liabilities being economically hedged change.\\xa0All derivative instruments are recognized on the Consolidated Balance Sheets at fair value (refer to Note 18 for additional information related to fair value measurements). The fair value of derivative assets is recognized within prepaid expenses and other current assets, while the fair value of derivative liabilities is recognized within other accrued liabilities. In accordance with U.S. GAAP, we offset certain derivative asset and liability balances, as well as certain amounts representing rights to reclaim cash collateral and obligations to return cash collateral, where master netting agreements provide for legal right of setoff. At May 28, 2023 and May 29, 2022 , amounts representing right to reclaim cash collateral and an obligation to return cash collateral of $ 21.3 and $ 4.0 million, respectively, were included in prepaid expenses and other current assets in our Consolidated Balance Sheets.\\xa0Derivative assets and liabilities and amounts representing a right to reclaim cash collateral or obligation to return cash collateral were reflected in our Consolidated Balance Sheets as follows:\\xa0 \\xa0 \\xa0 May 28, 2023 \\xa0 \\xa0 May 29, 2022 \\xa0 Prepaid expenses and other current assets\\xa0 $ 10.0 \\xa0 \\xa0 $ 7.0 \\xa0 Other accrued liabilities\\xa0 \\xa0 3.6 \\xa0 \\xa0 \\xa0 2.2 \\xa0  \\xa0The following table presents our derivative assets and liabilities at May 28, 2023 , on a gross basis, prior to the setoff of $ 8.3 million to total derivative assets and $ 13.0 million to total derivative liabilities where legal right of setoff existed:\\xa0 \\xa0 Derivative Assets \\xa0 \\xa0 Derivative Liabilities \\xa0 \\xa0 Balance Sheet Location \\xa0 Fair Value \\xa0 \\xa0 Balance Sheet Location \\xa0 Fair Value \\xa0 Commodity contractsPrepaid expenses and other current assets \\xa0 $ 1.1 \\xa0 \\xa0 Other accrued liabilities \\xa0 $ 14.4 \\xa0 Foreign exchange contractsPrepaid expenses and other current assets \\xa0 \\xa0 0.6 \\xa0 \\xa0 Other accrued liabilities \\xa0 \\xa0 2.2 \\xa0 Total derivatives not designated as hedging instruments \\xa0 $ 1.7 \\xa0 \\xa0 \\xa0 \\xa0 $ 16.6 \\xa0  \\xa0Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements Fiscal Years Ended May 28, 2023, May 29, 2022, and May 30, 2021 (columnar dollars in millions except per share amounts) \\xa0 The following table presents our derivative assets and liabilities, at May 29, 2022 , on a gross basis, prior to the setoff of $ 20.1 million to total derivative assets and $ 16.1 million to total derivative liabilities where legal right of setoff existed:\\xa0 \\xa0 Derivative Assets \\xa0 \\xa0 Derivative Liabilities \\xa0 \\xa0 Balance Sheet Location \\xa0 Fair Value \\xa0 \\xa0 Balance Sheet Location \\xa0 Fair Value \\xa0 Commodity contractsPrepaid expenses and other current assets \\xa0 $ 26.8 \\xa0 \\xa0 Other accrued liabilities \\xa0 $ 16.1 \\xa0 Foreign exchange contractsPrepaid expenses and other current assets \\xa0 \\xa0 0.3 \\xa0 \\xa0 Other accrued liabilities \\xa0 \\xa0 2.2 \\xa0 Total derivatives not designated as hedging instruments \\xa0 $ 27.1 \\xa0 \\xa0 \\xa0 \\xa0 $ 18.3 \\xa0  \\xa0The location and amount of gains (losses) from derivatives not designated as hedging instruments in our Consolidated Statements of Earnings were as follows:\\xa0 \\xa0 For the Fiscal Year Ended May 28, 2023 \\xa0 Derivatives Not Designated as Hedging Instruments Location in Consolidated Statement of Earnings of Gains (Losses) Recognized on Derivatives \\xa0 Amount of Gains (Losses) Recognized on Derivatives in Consolidated Statement of Earnings \\xa0 Commodity contractsCost of goods sold \\xa0 $ ( 19.7 ) Foreign exchange contractsCost of goods sold \\xa0 \\xa0 2.1 \\xa0 Total losses from derivative instruments not designated as hedging instruments \\xa0 $ ( 17.6 )  \\xa0 \\xa0 For the Fiscal Year Ended May 29, 2022 \\xa0 Derivatives Not Designated as Hedging Instruments Location in Consolidated Statement of Earnings of Gains (Losses) Recognized on Derivatives \\xa0 Amount of Gains (Losses) Recognized on Derivatives in Consolidated Statement of Earnings \\xa0 Commodity contractsCost of goods sold \\xa0 $ 33.4 \\xa0 Foreign exchange contractsCost of goods sold \\xa0 \\xa0 3.7 \\xa0 Total gains from derivative instruments not designated as hedging instruments \\xa0 $ 37.1 \\xa0  \\xa0 \\xa0 For the Fiscal Year Ended May 30, 2021 \\xa0 Derivatives Not Designated as Hedging Instruments Location in Consolidated Statement of Earnings of Gains (Losses) Recognized on Derivatives \\xa0 Amount of Gains (Losses) Recognized on Derivatives in Consolidated Statement of Earnings \\xa0 Commodity contractsCost of goods sold \\xa0 $ 26.6 \\xa0 Foreign exchange contractsCost of goods sold \\xa0 \\xa0 ( 17.1 ) Total gains from derivative instruments not designated as hedging instruments \\xa0 $ 9.5 \\xa0  \\xa0Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements Fiscal Years Ended May 28, 2023, May 29, 2022, and May 30, 2021 (columnar dollars in millions except per share amounts) \\xa0 As of May 28, 2023 , our open commodity contracts had a notional value (defined as notional quantity times market value per notional quantity unit) of $ 134.6 million for purchase contracts. As of May 29, 2022 , our open commodity contracts had a notional value of $ 115.3 million and $ 96.7 million for purchase and sales contracts, respectively. The notional amount of our foreign currency forward and cross currency swap contracts as of May 28, 2023 and May 29, 2022 was $ 87.3 million and $ 106.6 million, respectively.\\xa0We enter into certain commodity, interest rate, and foreign exchange derivatives with a diversified group of counterparties. We continually monitor our positions and the credit ratings of the counterparties involved and limit the amount of credit exposure to any one party. These transactions may expose us to potential losses due to the risk of nonperformance by these counterparties. We have not incurred a material loss due to nonperformance in any period presented and do not expect to incur any such material loss. We also enter into futures and options transactions through various regulated exchanges.\\xa0At May 28, 2023 , the maximum amount of loss due to the credit risk of the counterparties, had the counterparties failed to perform according to the terms of the contracts, was $ 0.6 million.\\xa017. PENSION AND POSTRETIREMENT BENEFITS \\xa0We have defined benefit retirement plans (\"pension plans\") for eligible salaried and hourly employees. Benefits are based on years of credited service and average compensation or stated amounts for each year of service. We also sponsor postretirement plans which provide certain medical and dental benefits to qualifying U.S. employees. Effective August 1, 2013, our defined benefit pension plan for eligible salaried employees was closed to new hire salaried employees. New hire salaried employees will generally be eligible to participate in our defined contribution plan.\\xa0We recognize the funded status of our pension and postretirement plans in the Consolidated Balance Sheets. For our pension plans, we also recognize as a component of accumulated other comprehensive income (loss), the net of tax results of the actuarial gains or losses within the corridor and prior service costs or credits that arise during the period but are not recognized in net periodic benefit cost. For our postretirement plans, we also recognize as a component of accumulated other comprehensive income (loss), the net of tax results of the gains or losses and prior service costs or credits that arise during the period but are not recognized in net periodic benefit cost. These amounts will be adjusted out of accumulated other comprehensive income (loss) as they are subsequently recognized as components of net periodic benefit cost. For our pension plans, we have elected to immediately recognize actuarial gains and losses in our operating results in the year in which they occur, to the extent they exceed the corridor, eliminating amortization. Amounts are included in the components of pension and postretirement plan costs, below, as recognized net actuarial loss.\\xa0Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements Fiscal Years Ended May 28, 2023, May 29, 2022, and May 30, 2021 (columnar dollars in millions except per share amounts) \\xa0 The changes in benefit obligations and plan assets at May 28, 2023 and May 29, 2022 are presented in the following table.\\xa0 \\xa0 \\xa0 Pension Plans \\xa0 \\xa0 Postretirement Plans \\xa0 \\xa0 \\xa0 2023 \\xa0 \\xa0 2022 \\xa0 \\xa0 2023 \\xa0 \\xa0 2022 \\xa0 Change in Benefit Obligation \\xa0 \\xa0 \\xa0 \\xa0 \\xa0 \\xa0 \\xa0 \\xa0 \\xa0 \\xa0 \\xa0 \\xa0 \\xa0 \\xa0 \\xa0 \\xa0 Benefit obligation at beginning of year\\xa0 $ 3,132.6 \\xa0 \\xa0 $ 3,739.2 \\xa0 \\xa0 $ 64.8 \\xa0 \\xa0 $ 81.5 \\xa0 Service cost\\xa0 \\xa0 6.5 \\xa0 \\xa0 \\xa0 8.7 \\xa0 \\xa0 \\xa0 0.1 \\xa0 \\xa0 \\xa0 0.2 \\xa0 Interest cost\\xa0 \\xa0 124.0 \\xa0 \\xa0 \\xa0 83.3 \\xa0 \\xa0 \\xa0 2.3 \\xa0 \\xa0 \\xa0 1.3 \\xa0 Amendments\\xa0 \\xa0 3.0 \\xa0 \\xa0 \\xa0 3.7 \\xa0 \\xa0 \\xa0 — \\xa0 \\xa0 \\xa0 — \\xa0 Actuarial gain\\xa0 \\xa0 ( 265.5 ) \\xa0 \\xa0 ( 503.1 ) \\xa0 \\xa0 ( 6.3 ) \\xa0 \\xa0 ( 9.5 ) Benefits paid\\xa0 \\xa0 ( 199.3 ) \\xa0 \\xa0 ( 198.3 ) \\xa0 \\xa0 ( 7.3 ) \\xa0 \\xa0 ( 8.2 ) Currency\\xa0 \\xa0 ( 1.1 ) \\xa0 \\xa0 ( 0.9 ) \\xa0 \\xa0 ( 0.4 ) \\xa0 \\xa0 ( 0.5 ) Benefit obligation at end of year\\xa0 $ 2,800.2 \\xa0 \\xa0 $ 3,132.6 \\xa0 \\xa0 $ 53.2 \\xa0 \\xa0 $ 64.8 \\xa0 Change in Plan Assets \\xa0 \\xa0 \\xa0 \\xa0 \\xa0 \\xa0 \\xa0 \\xa0 \\xa0 \\xa0 \\xa0 \\xa0 \\xa0 \\xa0 \\xa0 \\xa0 Fair value of plan assets at beginning of year\\xa0 $ 3,294.7 \\xa0 \\xa0 $ 3,848.8 \\xa0 \\xa0 $ 3.4 \\xa0 \\xa0 $ 3.3 \\xa0 Actual return on plan assets\\xa0 \\xa0 ( 158.1 ) \\xa0 \\xa0 ( 366.1 ) \\xa0 \\xa0 0.1 \\xa0 \\xa0 \\xa0 0.1 \\xa0 Employer contributions\\xa0 \\xa0 12.5 \\xa0 \\xa0 \\xa0 11.5 \\xa0 \\xa0 \\xa0 7.3 \\xa0 \\xa0 \\xa0 8.2 \\xa0 Benefits paid\\xa0 \\xa0 ( 199.3 ) \\xa0 \\xa0 ( 198.4 ) \\xa0 \\xa0 ( 7.3 ) \\xa0 \\xa0 ( 8.2 ) Currency\\xa0 \\xa0 ( 1.3 ) \\xa0 \\xa0 ( 1.1 ) \\xa0 \\xa0 — \\xa0 \\xa0 \\xa0 — \\xa0 Fair value of plan assets at end of year\\xa0 $ 2,948.5 \\xa0 \\xa0 $ 3,294.7 \\xa0 \\xa0 $ 3.5 \\xa0 \\xa0 $ 3.4 \\xa0  \\xa0The $ 265.5 million actuarial gain reducing our projected benefit obligation at the end of fiscal 2023 is principally related to the increase in the discount rate from 4.48 % to 5.50 %.

Such investments are generally considered long-term in nature with varying redemption availability. For certain of these investments, with a fair value of approximately $ 26.2 million as of May 28, 2023 , the asset managers have the ability to impose customary redemption gates which may further restrict or limit the redemption of invested funds therein. As of May 28, 2023 , no such gates were imposed.\\xa0As of May 28, 2023 , we have unfunded commitments for additional investments of $ 35.2 million in private equity funds and $ 10.1 million in natural resources funds. We expect unfunded commitments to be funded from plan assets rather than the general assets of the Company.\\xa0To develop the expected long-term rate of return on plan assets assumption for the pension plans, we consider the current asset allocation strategy, the historical investment performance, and the expectations for future returns of each asset class.\\xa0Our pension plan weighted-average asset allocations by asset category were as follows:\\xa0 \\xa0 \\xa0 May 28, 2023 \\xa0 \\xa0 May 29, 2022 \\xa0 Equity securities\\xa0 \\xa0 4 % \\xa0 \\xa0 4 % Debt securities\\xa0 \\xa0 84 % \\xa0 \\xa0 87 % Real estate funds\\xa0 \\xa0 1 % \\xa0 \\xa0 1 % Private equity\\xa0 \\xa0 4 % \\xa0 \\xa0 4 % Other\\xa0 \\xa0 7 % \\xa0 \\xa0 4 % Total\\xa0 \\xa0 100 % \\xa0 \\xa0 100 %  \\xa0Due to the salaried pension plan freeze that occurred in fiscal 2018, the Company\\'s pension asset strategy is now designed to align our pension plan assets with our projected benefit obligation to reduce volatility by targeting an investment strategy of approximately 90 % in fixed-income securities and approximately 10 % in return seeking assets, primarily equity securities, real estate, and private assets.\\xa0Assumed health care cost trend rates have a significant effect on the benefit obligation of the postretirement plans.\\xa0 Assumed Health Care Cost Trend Rates at: \\xa0 May 28, 2023 \\xa0 \\xa0 May 29, 2022 \\xa0 Initial health care cost trend rate\\xa0 \\xa0 6.92 % \\xa0 \\xa0 6.32 % Ultimate health care cost trend rate\\xa0 \\xa0 4.43 % \\xa0 \\xa0 4.44 % Year that the rate reaches the ultimate trend rate\\xa0 2034 \\xa0 \\xa0 2029 \\xa0  \\xa0We currently anticipate making contributions of approximately $ 12.1 million to our pension plans in fiscal 2024.

The risks of participating in such plans are different from the risks of single-employer plans, in the following respects:\\xa0 \\xa0 a.Assets contributed to a multiemployer plan by one employer may be used to provide benefits to employees of other participating employers. \\xa0 \\xa0 b.If a participating employer ceases to contribute to the plan, the unfunded obligations of the plan may be borne by the remaining participating employers. \\xa0 \\xa0 c.If the Company ceases to have an obligation to contribute to a multiemployer plan in which it had been a contributing employer, it may be required to pay to the plan an amount based on the underfunded status of the plan and on the history of the Company\\'s participation in the plan prior to the cessation of its obligation to contribute. The amount that an employer that has ceased to have an obligation to contribute to a multiemployer plan is required to pay to the plan is referred to as a withdrawal liability. \\xa0The Company\\'s participation in multiemployer plans for the fiscal year ended May 28, 2023 is outlined in the table below. For each plan that is individually significant to the Company the following information is provided:\\xa0 \\xa0 •The \"EIN / PN\" column provides the Employer Identification Number and the three -digit plan number assigned to a plan by the IRS. \\xa0 \\xa0 •The most recent Pension Protection Act Zone Status available for 2022 and 2021 is for plan years that ended in calendar years 2022 and 2021, respectively. The zone status is based on information provided to the Company by each plan.

FAIR VALUE MEASUREMENTS \\xa0Financial Accounting Standards Board guidance establishes a three -level fair value hierarchy based upon the assumptions (inputs) used to price assets or liabilities. The three levels of inputs used to measure fair value are as follows:\\xa0Level 1 \\xa0— Unadjusted quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities,\\xa0Level 2 \\xa0— Observable inputs other than those included in Level 1, such as quoted prices for similar assets and liabilities in active markets or quoted prices for identical assets or liabilities in inactive markets, and\\xa0Level 3 — Unobservable inputs reflecting our own assumptions and best estimate of what inputs market participants would use in pricing the asset or liability.\\xa0The fair values of our Level 2 derivative instruments were determined using valuation models that use market observable inputs including both forward and spot prices for currencies and commodities. Derivative assets and liabilities included in Level 2 primarily represent commodity and foreign currency option and forward contracts.\\xa0Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements Fiscal Years Ended May 28, 2023, May 29, 2022, and May 30, 2021 (columnar dollars in millions except per share amounts) \\xa0 The following table presents our financial assets and liabilities measured at fair value on a recurring basis, based upon the level within the fair value hierarchy in which the fair value measurements fall, as of May 28, 2023 :\\xa0 \\xa0 \\xa0 Level 1 \\xa0 \\xa0 Level 2 \\xa0 \\xa0 Level 3 \\xa0 \\xa0 Total \\xa0 Assets:\\xa0 \\xa0 \\xa0 \\xa0 \\xa0 \\xa0 \\xa0 \\xa0 \\xa0 \\xa0 \\xa0 \\xa0 \\xa0 \\xa0 \\xa0 \\xa0 Derivative assets\\xa0 $ 9.4 \\xa0 \\xa0 $ 0.6 \\xa0 \\xa0 $ — \\xa0 \\xa0 $ 10.0 \\xa0 Deferred compensation assets\\xa0 \\xa0 7.1 \\xa0 \\xa0 \\xa0 — \\xa0 \\xa0 \\xa0 — \\xa0 \\xa0 \\xa0 7.1 \\xa0 Available-for-sale debt securities\\xa0 \\xa0 — \\xa0 \\xa0 \\xa0 — \\xa0 \\xa0 \\xa0 4.0 \\xa0 \\xa0 \\xa0 4.0 \\xa0 Total assets\\xa0 $ 16.5 \\xa0 \\xa0 $ 0.6 \\xa0 \\xa0 $ 4.0 \\xa0 \\xa0 $ 21.1 \\xa0 Liabilities:\\xa0 \\xa0 \\xa0 \\xa0 \\xa0 \\xa0 \\xa0 \\xa0 \\xa0 \\xa0 \\xa0 \\xa0 \\xa0 \\xa0 \\xa0 \\xa0 Derivative liabilities\\xa0 $ — \\xa0 \\xa0 $ 3.6 \\xa0 \\xa0 $ — \\xa0 \\xa0 $ 3.6 \\xa0 Deferred compensation liabilities\\xa0 \\xa0 67.0 \\xa0 \\xa0 \\xa0 — \\xa0 \\xa0 \\xa0 — \\xa0 \\xa0 \\xa0 67.0 \\xa0 Total liabilities\\xa0 $ 67.0 \\xa0 \\xa0 $ 3.6 \\xa0 \\xa0 $ — \\xa0 \\xa0 $ 70.6 \\xa0  \\xa0The following table presents our financial assets and liabilities measured at fair value on a recurring basis, based upon the level within the fair value hierarchy in which the fair value measurements fall, as of May 29, 2022 :\\xa0 \\xa0 \\xa0 Level 1 \\xa0 \\xa0 Level 2 \\xa0 \\xa0 Level 3 \\xa0 \\xa0 Total \\xa0 Assets:\\xa0 \\xa0 \\xa0 \\xa0 \\xa0 \\xa0 \\xa0 \\xa0 \\xa0 \\xa0 \\xa0 \\xa0 \\xa0 \\xa0 \\xa0 \\xa0 Derivative assets\\xa0 $ 5.7 \\xa0 \\xa0 $ 1.3 \\xa0 \\xa0 $ — \\xa0 \\xa0 $ 7.0 \\xa0 Deferred compensation assets\\xa0 \\xa0 7.5 \\xa0 \\xa0 \\xa0 — \\xa0 \\xa0 \\xa0 — \\xa0 \\xa0 \\xa0 7.5 \\xa0 Available-for-sale debt securities\\xa0 \\xa0 — \\xa0 \\xa0 \\xa0 — \\xa0 \\xa0 \\xa0 7.6 \\xa0 \\xa0 \\xa0 7.6 \\xa0 Total assets\\xa0 $ 13.2 \\xa0 \\xa0 $ 1.3 \\xa0 \\xa0 $ 7.6 \\xa0 \\xa0 $ 22.1 \\xa0 Liabilities:\\xa0 \\xa0 \\xa0 \\xa0 \\xa0 \\xa0 \\xa0 \\xa0 \\xa0 \\xa0 \\xa0 \\xa0 \\xa0 \\xa0 \\xa0 \\xa0 Derivative liabilities\\xa0 $ — \\xa0 \\xa0 $ 2.2 \\xa0 \\xa0 $ — \\xa0 \\xa0 $ 2.2 \\xa0 Deferred compensation liabilities\\xa0 \\xa0 72.6 \\xa0 \\xa0 \\xa0 — \\xa0 \\xa0 \\xa0 — \\xa0 \\xa0 \\xa0 72.6 \\xa0 Total liabilities\\xa0 $ 72.6 \\xa0 \\xa0 $ 2.2 \\xa0 \\xa0 $ — \\xa0 \\xa0 $ 74.8 \\xa0  \\xa0Certain assets and liabilities, including long-lived assets, goodwill, asset retirement obligations, and equity investments are measured at fair value on a nonrecurring basis using Level 3 inputs.\\xa0During fiscal 2023, we recognized a credit loss of $ 3.9 million within SG&A expenses related to our convertible note receivable. The loss was measured using the best estimate of the present value of cash flows expected to be collected.\\xa0We recognized charges for the impairment of certain indefinite-lived brands. The fair values of these brands were estimated using the \"relief from royalty\" method (see Note 7 ). Impairments in our Grocery & Snacks segment totaled $ 78.9 million, $ 90.7 million, and $ 13.0 million for fiscal 2023, 2022, and 2021 , respectively. Impairments in our Refrigerated & Frozen segment totaled $ 496.6 million, $ 103.9 million, and $ 76.9 million for fiscal 2023, 2022, and 2021 , respectively. Impairments in our International segment totaled $ 13.7 million, $ 14.4 million, and $ 1.0 million for fiscal 2023, 2022, and 2021 , respectively.\\xa0During fiscal 2023, goodwill impairment charges totaling $ 141.7 million were recognized within our Refrigerated & Frozen segment. The impairments were measured using a discounted cash flow valuation model specific to the Sides, Components and Enhancers reporting unit (see Note 7 ).\\xa0During fiscal 2023, we recognized impairment charges totaling $ 0.5 million in our Grocery & Snacks segment, $ 5.7 million in our Refrigerated & Frozen segment, and $ 20.5 million in our Foodservice segment. During fiscal 2022, we recognized impairment charges totaling $ 26.3 million in our Grocery & Snacks segment, $ 28.9 million in our Refrigerated & Frozen segment, and $ 14.9 million in our Foodservice segment. The impairments were measured based upon the estimated sales price of a disposal group that no longer met the held for sale criteria as of the second quarter of fiscal 2023 \\xa0(see Note 5 ).\\xa0Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements Fiscal Years Ended May 28, 2023, May 29, 2022, and May 30, 2021 (columnar dollars in millions except per share amounts) \\xa0 We recognized charges for the impairment of certain long-lived assets measured based upon the estimated sales price of the assets. Impairments totaled $ 3.0 million in our Grocery & Snacks segment in fiscal 2021. \\xa0The carrying amount of long-term debt (including current installments) was $ 8.60 billion as of May 28, 2023 and $ 8.80 billion as of May 29, 2022 . Based on current market rates, the fair value of this debt (level 2 liabilities) at May 28, 2023 and May 29, 2022 was estimated at $ 8.31 billion and $ 8.85 billion, respectively.\\xa019. BUSINESS SEGMENTS AND RELATED INFORMATION \\xa0We reflect our results of operations in four reporting segments: Grocery & Snacks, Refrigerated & Frozen, International, and Foodservice.\\xa0The Grocery & Snacks reporting segment principally includes branded, shelf-stable food products sold in various retail channels in the United States.\\xa0The Refrigerated & Frozen reporting segment includes branded, temperature-controlled food products sold in various retail channels in the United States.\\xa0The International reporting segment principally includes branded food products, in various temperature states, sold in various retail and foodservice channels outside of the United States.\\xa0The Foodservice reporting segment includes branded and customized food products, including meals, entrees, sauces, and a variety of custom-manufactured culinary products packaged for sale to restaurants and other foodservice establishments primarily in the United States.\\xa0We do not aggregate operating segments when determining our reporting segments.\\xa0Operating profit for each of the segments is based on net sales less all identifiable operating expenses. General corporate expense, pension and postretirement non-service income, interest expense, net, income taxes, and equity method investment earnings have been excluded from segment operations.\\xa0Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements Fiscal Years Ended May 28, 2023, May 29, 2022, and May 30, 2021 (columnar dollars in millions except per share amounts) \\xa0  \\xa0 \\xa0 2023 \\xa0 \\xa0 2022 \\xa0 \\xa0 2021 \\xa0 Net sales\\xa0 \\xa0 \\xa0 \\xa0 \\xa0 \\xa0 \\xa0 \\xa0 \\xa0 \\xa0 \\xa0 \\xa0 Grocery & Snacks\\xa0 $ 4,981.9 \\xa0 \\xa0 $ 4,697.4 \\xa0 \\xa0 $ 4,624.7 \\xa0 Refrigerated & Frozen\\xa0 \\xa0 5,156.2 \\xa0 \\xa0 \\xa0 4,859.3 \\xa0 \\xa0 \\xa0 4,774.6 \\xa0 International\\xa0 \\xa0 1,002.5 \\xa0 \\xa0 \\xa0 970.8 \\xa0 \\xa0 \\xa0 938.6 \\xa0 Foodservice\\xa0 \\xa0 1,136.4 \\xa0 \\xa0 \\xa0 1,008.4 \\xa0 \\xa0 \\xa0 846.8 \\xa0 Total net sales\\xa0 $ 12,277.0 \\xa0 \\xa0 $ 11,535.9 \\xa0 \\xa0 $ 11,184.7 \\xa0 Operating profit\\xa0 \\xa0 \\xa0 \\xa0 \\xa0 \\xa0 \\xa0 \\xa0 \\xa0 \\xa0 \\xa0 \\xa0 Grocery & Snacks\\xa0 $ 1,002.8 \\xa0 \\xa0 $ 859.5 \\xa0 \\xa0 $ 1,092.7 \\xa0 Refrigerated & Frozen\\xa0 \\xa0 255.0 \\xa0 \\xa0 \\xa0 561.1 \\xa0 \\xa0 \\xa0 836.5 \\xa0 International\\xa0 \\xa0 121.4 \\xa0 \\xa0 \\xa0 106.7 \\xa0 \\xa0 \\xa0 131.8 \\xa0 Foodservice\\xa0 \\xa0 85.0 \\xa0 \\xa0 \\xa0 60.3 \\xa0 \\xa0 \\xa0 80.0 \\xa0 Total operating profit\\xa0 $ 1,464.2 \\xa0 \\xa0 $ 1,587.6 \\xa0 \\xa0 $ 2,141.0 \\xa0 Equity method investment earnings\\xa0 \\xa0 212.0 \\xa0 \\xa0 \\xa0 145.3 \\xa0 \\xa0 \\xa0 84.4 \\xa0 General corporate expenses\\xa0 \\xa0 388.9 \\xa0 \\xa0 \\xa0 241.6 \\xa0 \\xa0 \\xa0 364.8 \\xa0 Pension and postretirement non-service income\\xa0 \\xa0 24.2 \\xa0 \\xa0 \\xa0 67.3 \\xa0 \\xa0 \\xa0 54.5 \\xa0 Interest expense, net\\xa0 \\xa0 409.6 \\xa0 \\xa0 \\xa0 379.9 \\xa0 \\xa0 \\xa0 420.4 \\xa0 Income tax expense\\xa0 \\xa0 218.7 \\xa0 \\xa0 \\xa0 290.5 \\xa0 \\xa0 \\xa0 193.8 \\xa0 Net income\\xa0 $ 683.2 \\xa0 \\xa0 $ 888.2 \\xa0 \\xa0 $ 1,300.9 \\xa0 Less: Net income attributable to noncontrolling interests\\xa0 \\xa0 ( 0.4 ) \\xa0 \\xa0 — \\xa0 \\xa0 \\xa0 2.1 \\xa0 Net income attributable to Conagra Brands, Inc.\\xa0 $ 683.6 \\xa0 \\xa0 $ 888.2 \\xa0 \\xa0 $ 1,298.8 \\xa0  \\xa0The following table presents further disaggregation of our net sales:\\xa0 \\xa0 \\xa0 2023 \\xa0 \\xa0 2022 \\xa0 \\xa0 2021 \\xa0 Frozen\\xa0 $ 4,288.1 \\xa0 \\xa0 $ 4,091.1 \\xa0 \\xa0 $ 3,948.0 \\xa0 Staples\\xa0 \\xa0 \\xa0 \\xa0 \\xa0 \\xa0 \\xa0 \\xa0 \\xa0 \\xa0 \\xa0 \\xa0 Other shelf-stable\\xa0 \\xa0 2,851.9 \\xa0 \\xa0 \\xa0 2,729.5 \\xa0 \\xa0 \\xa0 2,830.2 \\xa0 Refrigerated\\xa0 \\xa0 868.1 \\xa0 \\xa0 \\xa0 768.2 \\xa0 \\xa0 \\xa0 826.6 \\xa0 Snacks\\xa0 \\xa0 2,130.0 \\xa0 \\xa0 \\xa0 1,967.9 \\xa0 \\xa0 \\xa0 1,794.5 \\xa0 International\\xa0 \\xa0 1,002.5 \\xa0 \\xa0 \\xa0 970.8 \\xa0 \\xa0 \\xa0 938.6 \\xa0 Foodservice\\xa0 \\xa0 1,136.4 \\xa0 \\xa0 \\xa0 1,008.4 \\xa0 \\xa0 \\xa0 846.8 \\xa0 Total net sales\\xa0 $ 12,277.0 \\xa0 \\xa0 $ 11,535.9 \\xa0 \\xa0 $ 11,184.7 \\xa0  \\xa0To be consistent with how we present certain disaggregated net sales information to investors, we have categorized certain net sales of our segments as \"Staples\", which includes all of our U.S. domestic retail refrigerated products and other shelf-stable grocery products. Management continues to regularly review financial results and make decisions about allocating resources based upon the four reporting segments outlined above.\\xa0Presentation of Derivative Gains (Losses) from Economic Hedges of Forecasted Cash Flows in Segment Results \\xa0Derivatives used to manage commodity price risk and foreign currency risk are not designated for hedge accounting treatment. We believe these derivatives provide economic hedges of certain forecasted transactions. As such, these derivatives are recognized at fair market value with realized and unrealized gains and losses recognized in general corporate expenses. The gains and losses are subsequently recognized in the operating results of the reporting segments in the period in which the underlying transaction being economically hedged is included in earnings. In the event that management determines a particular derivative entered into as an economic hedge of a forecasted commodity purchase has ceased to function as an economic hedge, we cease recognizing further gains and losses on such derivatives in corporate expense and begin recognizing such gains and losses within segment operating results, immediately.\\xa0Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements Fiscal Years Ended May 28, 2023, May 29, 2022, and May 30, 2021 (columnar dollars in millions except per share amounts) \\xa0 The following table presents the net derivative gains (losses) from economic hedges of forecasted commodity consumption and the foreign currency risk of certain forecasted transactions, under this methodology:\\xa0 \\xa0 \\xa0 2023 \\xa0 \\xa0 2022 \\xa0 \\xa0 2021 \\xa0 Net derivative gains (losses) incurred\\xa0 $ ( 17.6 ) \\xa0 $ 37.1 \\xa0 \\xa0 $ 9.5 \\xa0 Less: Net derivative gains (losses) allocated to reporting segments\\xa0 \\xa0 19.5 \\xa0 \\xa0 \\xa0 32.7 \\xa0 \\xa0 \\xa0 ( 6.1 ) Net derivative gains (losses) recognized in general corporate expenses\\xa0 $ ( 37.1 ) \\xa0 $ 4.4 \\xa0 \\xa0 $ 15.6 \\xa0 Net derivative gains (losses) allocated to Grocery & Snacks\\xa0 $ 6.0 \\xa0 \\xa0 $ 17.3 \\xa0 \\xa0 $ ( 2.3 ) Net derivative gains (losses) allocated to Refrigerated & Frozen\\xa0 \\xa0 9.6 \\xa0 \\xa0 \\xa0 17.4 \\xa0 \\xa0 \\xa0 ( 1.7 ) Net derivative gains (losses) allocated to International\\xa0 \\xa0 2.5 \\xa0 \\xa0 \\xa0 ( 3.6 ) \\xa0 \\xa0 ( 1.7 ) Net derivative gains (losses) allocated to Foodservice\\xa0 \\xa0 1.4 \\xa0 \\xa0 \\xa0 1.6 \\xa0 \\xa0 \\xa0 ( 0.4 ) Net derivative gains (losses) included in segment operating profit\\xa0 $ 19.5 \\xa0 \\xa0 $ 32.7 \\xa0 \\xa0 $ ( 6.1 )  \\xa0As of May 28, 2023 , the cumulative amount of net derivative losses from economic hedges that had been recognized in general corporate expenses and not yet allocated to reporting segments was $ 21.2 million. This amount reflected net losses of $ 21.4 million incurred during the fiscal year ended May 28, 2023 , as well as net gains of $ 0.2 million incurred prior to fiscal 2023 . Based on our forecasts of the timing of recognition of the underlying hedged items, we expect to reclassify to segment operating results net losses of $ 20.1 million in fiscal 2024 and $ 1.1 million in fiscal 2025 and thereafter.\\xa0Assets by Segment \\xa0The majority of our manufacturing assets are shared across multiple reporting segments. Output from these facilities used by each reporting segment can change over time. Also, working capital balances are not tracked by reporting segment. Therefore, it is impracticable to allocate those assets to the reporting segments, as well as disclose total assets by segment. Total depreciation expense for fiscal 2023, 2022, and 2021 was $ 313.1 million, $ 316.1 million, and $ 328.0 million, respectively.\\xa0Other Information \\xa0Our operations are principally in the United States. With respect to operations outside of the United States, no single foreign country or geographic region was significant with respect to consolidated operations for fiscal 2023, 2022, and 2021 . Foreign net sales, including sales by domestic segments to customers located outside of the United States, were approximately $ 1.04 billion, $ 1.00 billion, and $ 960.5 million in fiscal 2023, 2022, and 2021 , respectively. Our long-lived assets located outside of the United States are not significant.\\xa0Our largest customer, Walmart, Inc. and its affiliates, accounted for approximately 28 %, 27 %, and 26 % of consolidated net sales for fiscal 2023, 2022, and 2021 , respectively, significantly impacting the Grocery & Snacks and Refrigerated & Frozen segments.\\xa0Walmart, Inc. and its affiliates accounted for approximately 29 % and 30 % of consolidated net receivables as of May 28, 2023 and May 29, 2022 , respectively.\\xa0Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements Fiscal Years Ended May 28, 2023, May 29, 2022, and May 30, 2021 (columnar dollars in millions except per share amounts) \\xa0 Report of Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm \\xa0\\xa0To the Stockholders and Board of Directors Conagra Brands, Inc.:\\xa0Opinions on the Consolidated Financial Statements and Internal Control Over Financial Reporting \\xa0We have audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheets of Conagra Brands, Inc. and subsidiaries (the Company) as of May 28, 2023 and May 29, 2022, the related consolidated statements of earnings, comprehensive income, common stockholders’ equity, and cash flows for each of the fiscal years in the three-year period ended May 28, 2023, and the related notes (collectively, the consolidated financial statements). We also have audited the Company’s internal control over financial reporting as of May 28, 2023, based on criteria established in Internal Control – Integrated Framework (2013) issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission.\\xa0In our opinion, the consolidated financial statements referred to above present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of the Company as of May 28, 2023 and May 29, 2022, and the results of its operations and its cash flows for each of the fiscal years in the three-year period ended May 28, 2023, in conformity with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles. Also in our opinion, the Company maintained, in all material respects, effective internal control over financial reporting as of May 28, 2023 based on criteria established in Internal Control – Integrated Framework (2013) issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission.\\xa0Basis for Opinions \\xa0The Company’s management is responsible for these consolidated financial statements, for maintaining effective internal control over financial reporting, and for its assessment of the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting, included in the accompanying Management\\'s Annual Report on Internal Control Over Financial Reporting. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the Company’s consolidated financial statements and an opinion on the Company’s internal control over financial reporting based on our audits. We are a public accounting firm registered with the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States) (PCAOB) and are required to be independent with respect to the Company in accordance with the U.S. federal securities laws and the applicable rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB.\\xa0We conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audits to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the consolidated financial statements are free of material misstatement, whether due to error or fraud, and whether effective internal control over financial reporting was maintained in all material respects.\\xa0Our audits of the consolidated financial statements included performing procedures to assess the risks of material misstatement of the consolidated financial statements, whether due to error or fraud, and performing procedures that respond to those risks. Such procedures included examining, on a test basis, evidence regarding the amounts and disclosures in the consolidated financial statements. Our audits also included evaluating the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall presentation of the consolidated financial statements. Our audit of internal control over financial reporting included obtaining an understanding of internal control over financial reporting, assessing the risk that a material weakness exists, and testing and evaluating the design and operating effectiveness of internal control based on the assessed risk. Our audits also included performing such other procedures as we considered necessary in the circumstances. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinions.\\xa0Definition and Limitations of Internal Control Over Financial Reporting \\xa0', 'A company’s internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. A company’s internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that (1) pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company; (2) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the company; and (3) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the company’s assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements.', '\\xa0\\xa0Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.\\xa0Critical Audit Matter \\xa0The critical audit matter communicated below is a matter arising from the current period audit of the consolidated financial statements that was communicated or required to be communicated to the audit committee and that: (1) relates to accounts or disclosures that are material to the consolidated financial statements and (2) involved our especially challenging, subjective, or complex judgments. The communication of a critical audit matter does not alter in any way our opinion on the consolidated financial statements, taken as a whole, and we are not, by communicating the critical audit matter below, providing a separate opinion on the critical audit matter or on the accounts or disclosures to which it relates.\\xa0Evaluation of the recoverability of the carrying value of certain indefinite-lived intangible assets and goodwill \\xa0As described in Notes 1 and 7 to the consolidated financial statements, indefinite-lived intangible assets (consisting primarily of brand names and trademarks) and goodwill as of May 28, 2023 were $2.47 billion and $11.18 billion, respectively. For the fiscal year ended May 28, 2023, the Company recorded impairment charges totaling $589.2 million and $141.7 million on indefinite-lived intangible assets and goodwill, respectively. In assessing indefinite-lived intangible assets and goodwill for impairment, the Company performs either a qualitative or quantitative assessment at least annually or whenever circumstances indicate a potential impairment exists. When a quantitative assessment is performed for indefinite-lived intangible assets, the Company estimates the fair value of the intangibles by utilizing a discounted cash flow model that incorporates an estimated royalty rate that would be charged to a third party for the use of the brand. When a quantitative assessment is performed for goodwill, the Company estimates the fair value of the reporting unit by utilizing a discounted cash flow model. Impairment charges are recorded for any intangible assets or goodwill with carrying values in excess of their respective estimated fair values.\\xa0We identified the evaluation of the recoverability of the carrying value of certain indefinite-lived intangible assets and the goodwill assigned to the Sides, Components, Enhancers reporting unit as a critical audit matter. In evaluating the recoverability of the carrying value of certain identified-lived intangible assets and the goodwill assigned to the Sides, Components, Enhancers reporting unit the Company performed quantitative impairment tests. Subjective and challenging auditor judgment was required to evaluate certain assumptions used in determining the fair value of these assets. These assumptions included the forecasted revenue growth rates including the terminal growth rates and forecasted margins, royalty rates, and discount rates.\\xa0The following are the primary procedures we performed to address this critical audit matter. We evaluated the design and tested the operating effectiveness of internal controls over the quantitative impairment assessments, including controls over the development of the assumptions described above. To assess the Company’s ability to forecast, we compared historical forecasts to actual results. We evaluated the forecasted revenue growth rates including the terminal growth rates and forecasted margins, which were also used to support the royalty rates used in the indefinite-lived asset impairment testing, by considering current and past performance, as well as external market and industry outlook data. We also involved valuation professionals with specialized skills and knowledge, who assisted in:\\xa0 \\xa0 •evaluating the terminal growth rates by comparing them to publicly available market data;  \\xa0 \\xa0 •evaluating the royalty rates by determining that the selected royalty rates are supported by the associated brand name’s margin;  \\xa0 \\xa0 •evaluating the discount rates used by the Company by comparing the Company’s inputs to the discount rates to publicly available data for comparable entities and assessing the resulting discount rate; and  \\xa0 \\xa0 •testing the estimated brand names’ fair values and fair value of the Sides, Components, Enhancers reporting unit using the Company’s assumptions and comparing the results to the Company’s fair value estimate.  \\xa0/s/ KPMG LLP \\xa0We have served as the Company’s auditor since 2005.\\xa0Omaha, Nebraska July 13, 2023\\xa0\\xa0']\n"

       "{'Risks Related to our Industry ': \"\\n\\nThe successful development and commercialization of Corteva's pipeline products will be necessary for Corteva's growth. \\n\\nCorteva uses advanced breeding technologies to produce hybrids and varieties with superior performance in farmers&#8217; fields and uses biotechnology to introduce traits that enhance specific characteristics of its crops. Corteva also uses advanced analytics, software tools, mobile communications and new planting and monitoring equipment to provide agronomic recommendations to growers. Additionally, Corteva conducts research into biological and chemical products to protect farmers&#8217; crops from pests and diseases and enhance plant productivity. \\n\\nNew product concepts may be abandoned for many reasons, including greater anticipated development costs, technical difficulties, lack of efficacy, regulatory obstacles or inability to market under regulatory frameworks, competition, inability to prove the original concept, lack of demand and the need to divert focus, from time to time, to other initiatives with perceived opportunities for better returns. The processes of active ingredient development or discovery, breeding, biotechnology trait discovery and development and trait integration are lengthy, and a very small percentage of the chemicals, genes and germplasm Corteva tests is selected for commercialization. Furthermore, the length of time and the risk associated with the breeding and biotech pipelines are interlinked because both are required as a package for commercial success in markets where biotech traits are approved for growers, since seed hybrids and varieties could require modification to tolerate higher doses and/or new varieties of herbicides and pesticides as weeds and insects develop resistance. Commercial transitions to the company&#8217;s new technologies can take several years to complete, and weed and insect resistance may develop faster than Corteva can respond with new technologies or enhancements to existing technologies. In countries where biotech traits are not approved for widespread use, Corteva&#8217;s seed sales depend on the quality of its germplasm. While initial commercialization efforts have been promising, there are no guarantees that anticipated levels of product acceptability within Corteva's markets will be achieved or that higher quality products will not be developed by Corteva's competitors in the future. \\n\\nSpeed in discovering, developing, protecting and responding to new technologies, including new technology-based distribution channels that could facilitate Corteva&#8217;s ability to engage with customers and end users, and bringing related products to market is a significant competitive advantage. Commercial success frequently depends on being the first company to the market, and many of Corteva&#8217;s competitors are also making considerable investments in similar new biotechnology products, improved germplasm products, biological and chemical products and agronomic recommendation products. \\n\\nCorteva may not be able to obtain or maintain the necessary regulatory approvals for some of its products, including its seed and crop protection products, which could restrict its ability to sell those products in some markets. \\n\\nRegulatory and legislative requirements affect the development, manufacture and distribution of Corteva&#8217;s products, including the testing and planting of seeds containing Corteva&#8217;s biotechnology traits and the import of crops grown from those seeds, and non-compliance can harm Corteva&#8217;s sales and profitability. \\n\\nSeed products incorporating biotechnology derived traits and crop protection products must be extensively tested for safety, efficacy and environmental impact before they can be registered for production, use, sale or commercialization in a given market. In certain jurisdictions, Corteva must periodically renew its approvals for both biotechnology and crop protection products, which typically require Corteva to demonstrate compliance with then-current standards which generally are more stringent since the prior registration. The regulatory approvals process is lengthy, costly, complex and in some markets unpredictable, with requirements that can vary by product, technology, industry and country. The regulatory approvals process for products that incorporate novel modes of action or new technologies can be particularly unpredictable and uncertain due to the then-current state of regulatory guidelines and objectives, as well as governmental policy considerations and non- governmental organization and other stakeholder considerations. The uncertainty and increased length of regulatory approvals may reduce Corteva&#8217;s return on its research and development investments, and impede its ability to meet sales, profitability, or sustainability metrics. \\n\\nFurthermore, the detection of biotechnology traits or chemical residues from a crop protection product not approved in the country in which Corteva sells or cultivates its product, or in a country to which Corteva imports its product, may affect Corteva&#8217;s ability to supply or export its products, or even result in crop destruction, product recalls or trade disruption, which could result in lawsuits and termination of licenses related to biotechnology traits and raw material supply agreements. Delays \\n\\nPart I \\n\\nITEM 1A. RISK FACTORS, continued \\n\\nin obtaining regulatory approvals to import, including those related to the importation of crops grown from seeds containing certain traits or treated with specific chemicals, may influence the rate of adoption of new products in globally traded crops. \\n\\nAdditionally, the regulatory environment may be impacted by the activities of non-governmental organizations and special interest groups and stakeholder reaction to actual or perceived impacts of new and existing technology, products or processes on safety, health and the environment. Obtaining and maintaining regulatory approvals requires submitting a significant amount of information and data, which may require participation from technology providers. Regulatory standards and trial procedures are continuously changing. In addition, Corteva has seen an increase in recent years in the number of lawsuits filed by those who identify themselves as public or environmental interest groups seeking to invalidate pesticide product registrations and/or challenge the way federal or state governmental entities apply the rules and regulations governing pesticide produce use. The pace of change together with the lack of regulatory harmony could result in unintended noncompliance. Responding to these changes and meeting existing and new requirements may involve significant costs or capital expenditures or require changes in business practice that could result in reduced profitability. The failure to receive necessary permits or approvals could have near- and long-term effects on Corteva&#8217;s ability to produce and sell some current and future products. \\n\\nThe degree of public understanding and acceptance or perceived public acceptance of Corteva&#8217;s biotechnology and other agricultural products and technologies can affect Corteva&#8217;s sales and results of operations by affecting planting approvals, regulatory requirements and customer purchase decisions. \\n\\nConcerns and claims regarding the safe use of seeds with biotechnology traits and crop protection products in general, their potential impact on health and the environment, and the perceived impacts of biotechnology on health and the environment, reflect a growing trend in societal demands for increasing levels of product safety and environmental protection. These include concerns and claims that increased use of crop protection products, drift, inversion, volatilization and the use of biotechnology traits meant to reduce the resistance of weeds or pests to control by crop protection products, could increase or accelerate such resistance and otherwise negatively impact health and the environment. These and other concerns could manifest themselves in stockholder proposals, preferred purchasing, delays or failures in obtaining or retaining regulatory approvals, delayed product launches, lack of market acceptance, product discontinuation, continued pressure for and adoption of more stringent regulatory intervention and litigation, termination of raw material supply agreements and legal claims. These and other concerns could also influence public perceptions, the viability or continued sales of certain of Corteva&#8217;s products, Corteva&#8217;s reputation and the cost to comply with regulations. As a result, such concerns could have a material adverse effect on Corteva&#8217;s business, results of operations, financial condition and cash flows. \\n\\nChanges in agricultural and related policies of governments and international organizations may prove unfavorable. \\n\\nIn many markets there are various pressures to reduce government subsidies to farmers, which may inhibit the growth in these markets of products used in agriculture. In addition, government programs that create incentives for farmers may be modified or discontinued. However, it is difficult to predict accurately whether, and if so when, such changes will occur. Corteva expects that the policies of governments and international organizations will continue to affect the planting choices made by growers as well as the income available to growers to purchase products used in agriculture and, accordingly, the operating results of the agriculture industry. \\n\\nThe costs of complying with evolving regulatory requirements could negatively impact Corteva&#8217;s business, results of operations and financial condition. Actual or alleged violations of environmental laws or permit requirements could result in restrictions or prohibitions on plant operations, substantial civil or criminal sanctions, as well as the assessment of strict liability and/or joint and several liability. \\n\\nCorteva is subject to extensive federal, state, local and foreign laws, regulations, rules and ordinances relating to pollution, protection of the environment, waste water discharges, the generation, storage, handling, transportation, treatment, disposal and remediation of hazardous substances and waste materials and the use of genetically modified seeds and crop protection active ingredients by growers. \\n\\nEnvironmental and health and safety laws, regulations and standards, including those with respect to PFAS and other substances, expose Corteva to the risk of substantial costs and liabilities, including liabilities associated with Corteva&#8217;s business and the discontinued and divested businesses and operations of EIDP. As is typical for businesses like Corteva&#8217;s, soil and groundwater contamination has occurred in the past at certain sites and may be identified at other sites in the future. Disposal of \\n\\nPart I \\n\\nITEM 1A. RISK FACTORS, continued \\n\\nwaste from Corteva&#8217;s business at off-site locations also exposes it to potential remediation costs. Consistent with past practice, Corteva is continuing to monitor, investigate and remediate soil and groundwater contamination at several of these sites. \\n\\nCosts and capital expenditures relating to environmental, health or safety matters are subject to evolving regulatory requirements and depend on the timing of the promulgation and enforcement of specific standards which impose the requirements. Moreover, changes in environmental regulations, including those related to climate change, could inhibit or interrupt Corteva&#8217;s operations, or require modifications to its facilities in the future. Accordingly, environmental, health or safety regulatory matters could result in significant unanticipated costs or liabilities, which may be materially higher than Corteva&#8217;s accruals. \\n\\nClimate change and unpredictable seasonal and weather factors could impact Corteva&#8217;s sales and earnings. \\n\\nThe agriculture industry is subject to seasonal and weather factors, which can vary unpredictably from period to period. Weather factors can affect the presence of disease and pests on a regional basis and, accordingly, can positively or adversely affect the demand for crop protection products, including the mix of products used or the level of returns. The weather also can affect supply chains and the quality, volume and cost of seed produced for sale as well as demand and product mix. Seed yields can be higher or lower than planned, which could lead to higher inventory and related write-offs. Climate change may increase the frequency or intensity of extreme weather such as storms, floods, heat waves, droughts and other events that could affect the quality, volume and cost of seed produced for sale as well as demand and product mix. Climate change may also affect the availability and suitability of arable land and contribute to unpredictable shifts in the average growing season and types of crops produced. \\n\\nCorteva&#8217;s business is subject to various competition and antitrust, rules and regulations around the world, and as the size of its business grows, scrutiny of its business by legislators and regulators in these areas may intensify. \\n\\nOn July 9, 2021, President Biden issued an executive order promoting competition in the American economy. The order encouraged further examination and efforts by U.S. regulatory agencies to avoid market concentrations for agricultural inputs, that could challenge the survival of family farms. The executive order also directs the U.S. Secretary of Agriculture to take action to ensure that the intellectual property system, while still incentivizing innovation, does not also unnecessarily reduce competition in seed and other agricultural input markets beyond what is reasonably contemplated by the U.S. Patent Act and propose strategies for addressing those concerns across intellectual property, antitrust, and other relevant laws. While the ultimate impact of the executive order will depend on the actions ultimately resulting from the U.S. regulatory authorities, actions taken by such authorities may increase the regulation and regulatory costs associated with the agriculture industry in the future and restrict the company from pursuing certain growth opportunities, including mergers and acquisitions. \\n\\nScrutiny from regulators in the U.S. and abroad may intensify as Corteva&#8217;s business presence grows. This scrutiny and related investigations, even when not resulting in an enforcement action, may result in damage to a company&#8217;s reputation, significant defense expense, as well as become a distraction to management. Antitrust and competition enforcement actions, including the current FTC and related state attorney general lawsuits pending against Corteva, may result in regulators imposing fines, penalties, or restrictions on a company&#8217;s business practices in a manner that may significantly impact its results of operations. \\n\\nCorteva participates in an industry that is highly competitive and has undergone consolidation, which could increase competitive pressures. \\n\\nCorteva currently faces significant competition in the markets in which it operates. In most segments of the market, the number of products available to the grower is steadily increasing as new products are introduced. At the same time, certain products are coming off patent and are thus available to generic manufacturers for production and commercialization. Upon the loss or expiration of patent protection for one of Corteva&#8217;s products or of a product that Corteva licenses, or upon the &#8220;at- risk&#8221; launch (despite pending patent infringement litigation against the generic product) by a generic manufacturer of a generic version of one of Corteva&#8217;s patented products or of a product that Corteva licenses, Corteva can lose a major portion of revenues for that product, which can have a material adverse effect on Corteva&#8217;s business. Additionally, data analytic tools and web-based new direct purchase models offer increased transparency and comparability, which creates price pressures. Corteva cannot predict the pricing or promotional actions of its competitors. Aggressive marketing or pricing by Corteva&#8217;s competitors could adversely affect Corteva&#8217;s business, results of operations and financial conditions. As a result, Corteva continues to face significant competitive challenges. \\n\\nPart I \\n\\nITEM 1A. RISK FACTORS, continued \\n\\nCorteva&#8217;s sales to its customers may be adversely affected should a company successfully establish an intermediary platform for the sale of Corteva&#8217;s products or otherwise position itself between Corteva and its customers. \\n\\nCorteva services customers in part through the Pioneer direct sales channel in key agricultural geographies, including the United States. In addition, Corteva supplements this approach with strong retail channels, including distributors, agricultural cooperatives and dealers, and with digital solutions that assist farmer decision-making with a view to optimize their product selection and maximize their yield and profitability. While Corteva expects its indirect channels will extend its reach and increase exposure of its products to other potential customers, including smaller farmers or farmers in less concentrated areas, there can be no assurance that Corteva will be successful in this regard. If a competitor were to successfully establish an intermediary platform for distribution of Corteva&#8217;s products, it may disrupt Corteva&#8217;s distribution model and inhibit Corteva&#8217;s ability to provide a complete go-to-market strategy covering the direct, dealer and retail channels. In such a circumstance, Corteva&#8217;s sales may be adversely affected. \\n\\n\",\n",
       " 'Risks Related to Our Operations ': '\\n\\nCorteva is dependent on its relationships or contracts with third parties with respect to certain of its raw materials or licenses and commercialization. \\n\\nCorteva is dependent on third parties in the research, development and commercialization of its products and enters into transactions including, but not limited to, supply agreements, licensing agreements, and manufacturing agreements in connection with Corteva&#8217;s business. The majority of Corteva&#8217;s corn hybrids and soybean varieties sold to customers contain biotechnology traits that Corteva licenses from third parties under long-term licenses. If Corteva loses its rights under such licenses, it could negatively impact Corteva&#8217;s ability to obtain future licenses on competitive terms, commercialize new products and generate sales from existing products. To maintain such licenses, Corteva may elect to out-license its technology, including germplasm. There can be no guarantee that such out-licensing will not ultimately strengthen Corteva&#8217;s competition thereby adversely impacting Corteva&#8217;s results of operations. \\n\\nWhile Corteva relies heavily on third parties for multiple aspects of its business and commercialization activities, Corteva does not control many aspects of such third parties&#8217; activities. Third parties may not complete activities on schedule or in accordance with Corteva&#8217;s expectations. Failure by one or more of these third parties to meet their contractual or other obligations to Corteva or to comply with applicable laws or regulations, or any disruption in the relationship between Corteva and one or more of these third parties could delay or prevent the development, approval or commercialization of Corteva&#8217;s products and could also result in non-compliance or reputational harm, all with potential negative implications for Corteva&#8217;s business. \\n\\nIn addition, Corteva&#8217;s agreements with third parties may obligate it to meet certain contractual or other obligations to third parties. For example, Corteva may be obligated to meet certain thresholds or abide by certain boundary conditions. If Corteva were to fail to meet such obligations to the third parties, its relationship with such third parties may be disrupted. Such a disruption could negatively impact certain of Corteva&#8217;s licenses on which it depends, could cause reputational harm, and could negatively affect Corteva&#8217;s business, results of operations and financial condition. \\n\\nVolatility in Corteva&#8217;s input costs, which include raw materials and production costs, could have a significant impact on Corteva&#8217;s business, results of operations and financial condition. \\n\\nCorteva&#8217;s input costs are variable based on the costs associated with production or with raw materials Corteva uses. For example, Corteva&#8217;s production costs vary, especially on a seasonal basis where changes in weather influence supply and demand. In addition, Corteva&#8217;s manufacturing processes consume significant amounts of raw materials, the costs of which are subject to worldwide supply and demand as well as other factors beyond Corteva&#8217;s control. Corteva refers to these costs collectively as input costs. Significant variations in input costs affect Corteva&#8217;s operating results from period to period. \\n\\nWhen possible, Corteva purchases raw materials through negotiated long-term contracts to minimize the impact of price fluctuations. Corteva also enters into over-the-counter and exchange traded derivative commodity instruments to hedge its exposure to price fluctuations on certain purchases. In addition, Corteva takes actions to offset the effects of higher input costs through selling price increases, productivity improvements and cost reduction programs. Success in offsetting higher input costs with price increases is largely influenced by competitive and economic conditions and could vary significantly depending on the market served. If Corteva is not able to fully offset the effects of higher input costs, it could have a significant impact on its financial results. \\n\\nPart I \\n\\nITEM 1A. RISK FACTORS, continued \\n\\nOur business, financial condition and results of operations could be materially affected by disruptions in the global economy caused by geopolitical and military conflicts. \\n\\nThe global economy has been negatively impacted by the military conflict between Russia and Ukraine. While we continue to conclude our business activities in Russia, we have experienced shortages in materials, the inability to insure shipments, and increased costs for transportation, energy, and raw material and other inputs due in part to the negative impact of the Russia-Ukraine military conflict on the global economy. Further escalation of the military conflict or related geopolitical tensions, including increased trade barriers or restrictions on global trade, could result in, among other things, cyberattacks, further supply disruptions, and changes to foreign exchange rates and financial markets, any of which may adversely affect our business and supply chains. Such geopolitical instability and uncertainty has negatively impacted our ability to sell to, ship products to, collect payments from, and support customers in certain regions. Logistics restrictions, including closures of air space and shipping ports, the reduction of the availability of farmable land, and the destruction of facilities could further increase these adverse impacts and negatively impact demand for our products in the region. \\n\\nSimilar or more severe disruptions, trade barriers, business risks, asset seizures, and volatility in foreign exchange and financial markets could occur if tensions or conflicts between China and Taiwan, or other countries, escalate, or if the United States would become a party to such a military conflict. Currently, a material portion of the company&#8217;s crop protection inputs are sourced directly or indirectly from China. While the company utilizes dual- or multi- source supply chains to minimize business disruptions, these strategies may not be adequate to address the scope of disruptions created by such a conflict. Further escalation or expansion of economic disruption or in the scope of global or regional conflicts could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations. \\n\\nCorteva&#8217;s business, results of operations and financial condition could be adversely affected by industrial espionage and other disruptions to its supply chain, information technology or network systems. \\n\\nBusiness and/or supply chain disruptions, plant and/or power outages and information technology system and/or network disruptions, regardless of cause including acts of sabotage, employee error or other actions, geo-political activity, military conflict, local epidemics or pandemics, weather events and natural disasters could seriously harm Corteva&#8217;s operations as well as the operations of its customers and suppliers. For example, a pandemic in locations where Corteva has significant operations, sales, or key suppliers could have a material adverse effect on Corteva&#8217;s results of operations. In addition, terrorist attacks and natural disasters have increased stakeholder concerns about the security and safety of chemical production and distribution. \\n\\nBusiness and/or supply chain disruptions may also be caused by security breaches, which could include, for example, ransomware attacks and attacks on information technology and infrastructure by hackers, viruses, breaches due to employee error or actions or other disruptions. Corteva and/or its suppliers may fail to effectively prevent, detect and recover from these or other security breaches and, as a consequence, such breaches could result in misuse of Corteva&#8217;s assets, business disruptions, loss of property including trade secrets and confidential business information, legal claims or proceedings, reporting errors, processing inefficiencies, negative media attention, loss of sales and interference with regulatory and data privacy compliance. \\n\\nLike most major corporations, Corteva is the target of industrial espionage, including cyber-attacks, from time to time. Corteva has determined that these incidents have resulted, and could result in the future, in unauthorized parties gaining access to certain confidential business information. However, to date, Corteva has not experienced any material financial impact, changes in the competitive environment or impact on business operations from these events. Although management does not believe that Corteva has experienced any material losses to date related to industrial espionage and security breaches, including cybersecurity incidents, there can be no assurance that Corteva will not suffer such losses in the future. \\n\\nCorteva actively manages the risks within its control that could lead to business disruptions and security breaches. As these threats continue to evolve, particularly around cybersecurity, Corteva may be required to expend significant resources to enhance its control environment, processes, practices and other protective measures. Despite these efforts, such events could also have a material adverse effect on Corteva&#8217;s business, financial condition, results of operations and reputation. Additionally, any losses from such an event may be excluded from, or in excess of the coverages provided by Corteva\\'s insurance policies. \\n\\nPart I \\n\\nITEM 1A. RISK FACTORS, continued \\n\\nCorteva&#8217;s business, results of operations and financial condition could be adversely affected by environmental, litigation and other commitments and contingencies. \\n\\nAs a result of Corteva&#8217;s operations, including past operations and those related to divested businesses and discontinued operations of EIDP, Corteva incurs environmental operating costs for pollution abatement activities including waste collection and disposal, installation and maintenance of air pollution controls and wastewater treatment, emissions testing and monitoring and obtaining permits. Corteva also incurs environmental operating costs related to environmental related research and development activities including environmental field and treatment studies as well as toxicity and degradation testing to evaluate the environmental impact of products and raw materials. In addition, Corteva maintains and periodically reviews and adjusts its accruals for probable environmental remediation and restoration costs. \\n\\nCorteva expects to continue to incur environmental operating costs since it will operate global manufacturing, product handling and distribution facilities that are subject to a broad array of environmental laws and regulations. These rules are subject to change by the implementing governmental agency, which Corteva monitors closely. Corteva&#8217;s policy requires that its operations fully meet or exceed legal and regulatory requirements. In addition, Corteva expects to continue certain voluntary programs, and could consider additional voluntary actions, to reduce air emissions, minimize the generation of hazardous waste, decrease the volume of water use and discharges, increase the efficiency of energy use and reduce the generation of persistent, bioaccumulative and toxic materials. Costs to comply with complex environmental laws and regulations, as well as internal voluntary programs and goals, are significant and Corteva expects these costs will continue to be significant for the foreseeable future. Over the long-term, such expenditures are subject to considerable uncertainty and could fluctuate significantly. \\n\\nCorteva accrues for environmental matters when it is probable that a liability has been incurred and the amount can be reasonably estimated. As remediation activities vary substantially in duration and cost from site to site, it is difficult to develop precise estimates of future site remediation costs. Corteva expects to base such estimates on several factors, including the complexity of the geology, the nature and extent of contamination, the type of remedy, the outcome of discussions with regulatory agencies and other Potentially Responsible Parties (&#8220;PRPs&#8221;) at multi-party sites and the number of, and financial viability of, other PRPs. Considerable uncertainty exists with respect to environmental remediation costs and, under adverse changes in circumstances, the potential liability may be materially higher than Corteva&#8217;s accruals. \\n\\nCorteva faces risks arising from various unasserted and asserted litigation matters arising out of the normal course of its current and former business operations, including intellectual property, commercial, product liability, environmental and antitrust lawsuits. Corteva has noted a trend in public and private suits being filed on behalf of states, counties, cities and utilities alleging harm to the general public and the environment, including waterways and watersheds. Claims alleging harm to the public and the environment may be brought against Corteva, notwithstanding years of scientific evidence and regulatory determinations supporting the safety of crop protection products. The litigation involving Monsanto&#8217;s Roundup &#174; non-selective glyphosate containing weedkiller products has resulted in negative publicity and sentiment and may lead to similar suits with respect to glyphosate-containing products and/or other established crop protection products. Claims and allegations that Corteva&#8217;s products or products that Corteva manufactures or markets on behalf of third parties are not safe could result in litigation, damage to Corteva&#8217;s reputation and have a material adverse effect on Corteva&#8217;s business. It is not possible to predict the outcome of these various proceedings and any potential impact on Corteva. An adverse outcome in any one or more of these matters may result in losses not fully covered by Corteva\\'s insurance policies, and could be material to Corteva\\'s financial results. Various factors or developments can lead to changes in current estimates of liabilities. Such factors and developments may include, but are not limited to, additional data, safety or risk assessments, as well as a final adverse judgment, significant settlement or changes in applicable law. A future adverse ruling or unfavorable development could result in future charges that could have a material adverse effect on Corteva. \\n\\nThe company, pursuant to the respective Separation Agreements, is entitled to cost sharing and indemnification from Chemours, Dow and DuPont, as applicable, for certain litigation, environmental, workers&#8217; compensation and other liabilities related to its historical operations. In connection with the recognition of liabilities related to these matters, Corteva records an indemnification asset when recovery is deemed probable. These estimates of recovery are subject to various factors and developments that could result in differences from future estimates or the actual recovery. As of December 31, 2022, the indemnification assets pursuant to the Chemours Separation Agreement and the Corteva Separation Agreement are in aggregate $99 million within accounts and notes receivable - net and $381 million within other assets in the company&#8217;s Consolidated Balance Sheet. Any failure by, or inability to pay, these liabilities in line with the indemnification provisions of the Separation Agreements may have a material adverse effect on Corteva and its financial condition and results of operations. \\n\\nPart I \\n\\nITEM 1A. RISK FACTORS, continued \\n\\nIn the ordinary course of business, Corteva may make certain commitments, including representations, warranties and indemnities relating to current and past operations, including those related to divested businesses and issue guarantees of third-party obligations. If Corteva were required to make payments as a result, they could exceed the amounts accrued, thereby adversely affecting Corteva&#8217;s financial condition and results of operations. \\n\\nCorteva&#8217;s operations outside the United States are subject to risks and restrictions, which could negatively affect Corteva&#8217;s business, results of operations and financial condition. \\n\\nCorteva&#8217;s operations outside the United States are subject to risks and restrictions, including fluctuations in foreign-currency exchange rates; inflation; exchange and price control regulations; corruption risks; competitive restrictions; changes in local political or economic conditions; import and trade restrictions; import or export licensing requirements and trade policy; and other potentially detrimental domestic and foreign governmental practices or policies affecting U.S. companies doing business abroad. In addition, Corteva&#8217;s international operations are sometimes in countries with unstable governments, economic or fiscal challenges, military or political conflicts, local epidemics or pandemics, significant levels of crime and organized crime, or developing legal systems. This may increase the risk to the company\\'s employees, subcontractors or other parties, and to other liabilities, such as property loss or damage to the company\\'s products, and may affect Corteva\\'s ability to safely operate in, or import into, or receive raw materials from these countries. \\n\\nAdditionally, Corteva&#8217;s ability to export its products and its sales outside the United States has been, and may continue to be adversely affected by significant changes in trade, tax or other policies, including the risk that other countries may retaliate through the imposition of their own trade restrictions and/or increased tariffs in response to substantial changes to U.S. trade and tax policies. \\n\\nAlthough Corteva has operations throughout the world, Corteva&#8217;s sales outside the United States in 2022 were principally to customers in Brazil, Eurozone countries, and Canada. Further, Corteva&#8217;s largest currency exposures are the Brazilian Real, Canadian dollar, South African Rand, Swiss franc, and European Euro (\"EUR\"). Inflation, market uncertainty or an economic downturn in these geographic areas could reduce demand for Corteva&#8217;s products and result in decreased sales volume, which could have a negative impact on Corteva&#8217;s results of operations. In addition, changes in exchange rates may affect Corteva&#8217;s results of operations, financial condition and cash flows in future periods. Corteva actively manages currency exposures that are associated with net monetary asset positions and committed purchases. \\n\\nFailure to effectively manage acquisitions, divestitures, alliances, restructurings, cost savings initiatives and other portfolio actions may not have the results anticipated. \\n\\nFrom time to time Corteva evaluates acquisition candidates that may strategically fit Corteva&#8217;s business and/or growth objectives. If Corteva is unable to successfully integrate and develop acquired businesses, including its acquisitions and growth in biologics, Corteva could fail to achieve expected increases in revenues and operating results, as well as anticipated synergies and cost savings which could have a material adverse effect on Corteva&#8217;s financial results. Corteva continually reviews its portfolio of assets for contributions to its objectives and alignment with its growth strategy. However, Corteva may not be successful in separating underperforming or non-strategic assets and gains or losses on the divestiture of, or lost operating income from, such assets may affect Corteva&#8217;s earnings. Moreover, Corteva might incur asset impairment charges related to acquisitions or divestitures that reduce its earnings. In addition, if the execution of these transactions, initiatives, or portfolio actions is not successful, it could adversely impact Corteva&#8217;s financial condition, cash flows and results of operations. \\n\\nCorteva&#8217;s liquidity, business, results of operations and financial condition could be impaired if it is unable to raise capital through the capital markets or short-term debt borrowings. \\n\\nAny limitation on Corteva&#8217;s ability to raise money in the capital markets or through short-term debt borrowings could have a substantial negative effect on Corteva&#8217;s liquidity. Corteva&#8217;s ability to affordably access the capital markets and/or borrow short- term debt in amounts adequate to finance its activities could be impaired as a result of a variety of factors, including factors that are not specific to Corteva, such as a severe disruption of the financial markets and, in the case of debt securities or borrowings, interest rate fluctuations. Due to the seasonality of Corteva&#8217;s business and the credit programs Corteva may offer its customers, net working capital investment and corresponding debt levels will fluctuate over the course of the year. \\n\\nCorteva regularly extends credit to its customers to enable them to purchase seeds or crop protection products at the beginning of the growing season. The customer receivables may be used as collateral for short-term financing programs. Any material \\n\\nPart I \\n\\nITEM 1A. RISK FACTORS, continued \\n\\nadverse effect upon Corteva&#8217;s ability to own or sell such customer receivables, including seasonal factors that may impact the amount of customer receivables Corteva owns, may materially impact Corteva&#8217;s access to capital. \\n\\nCorteva has additional agreements with financial institutions to establish programs that provide financing for select customers of Corteva&#8217;s seed and crop protection products in the United States, Latin America, Europe and Asia. The programs are renewed on an annual basis. In most cases, Corteva guarantees the extension of such credit to such customers. If Corteva is unable to renew these agreements or access the debt markets to support customer financing, Corteva&#8217;s sales may be negatively impacted, which could result in increased borrowing needs to fund working capital. \\n\\nCorteva&#8217;s earnings, operations and business, among other things, will impact its credit ratings, costs and availability of financing. There can be no assurance that Corteva or EIDP will maintain its current or prospective credit ratings. A decrease in the ratings assigned to Corteva or EIDP by the ratings agencies may negatively impact Corteva&#8217;s liquidity, access to the debt capital markets and increase Corteva&#8217;s cost of borrowing and the financing of its seasonal working capital. \\n\\nCorteva&#8217;s customers may be unable to pay their debts to Corteva, which could adversely affect Corteva&#8217;s results. \\n\\nCorteva offers its customers financing programs with credit terms generally less than one year from invoicing in alignment with the growing season. Due to these credit practices as well as the seasonality of Corteva&#8217;s operations, Corteva may need to issue short-term debt at certain times of the year to fund its cash flow requirements. Corteva&#8217;s customers may be exposed to a variety of conditions that could adversely affect their ability to pay their debts. For example, customers in economies experiencing an economic downturn or in a region experiencing adverse growing conditions may be unable to repay their obligations to Corteva, which could adversely affect Corteva&#8217;s results. \\n\\nIncreases in pension and other post-employment benefit plan funding obligations may adversely affect Corteva&#8217;s results of operations, liquidity or financial condition. \\n\\nThrough Corteva\\'s ownership of EIDP, Corteva maintains EIDP defined benefit pension and other post-employment benefit plans. For some of these plans, including EIDP&#8217;s principal U.S. pension plan, Corteva continues as sponsor for the entire plan regardless of whether participants, including retirees, are or were associated with EIDP&#8217;s agriculture business. Corteva uses many assumptions in calculating its expected future payment obligations under these plans. Significant adverse changes in credit or market conditions could result in actual rates of returns on pension investments being lower than assumed. In addition, expected future payment obligations may be adversely impacted by changes in assumptions regarding participants, including retirees. In 2023, Corteva expects to contribute approximately $50 million to its pension plans other than the principal U.S. pension plan, and about $135 million for its other post-employment benefit (\"OPEB\") plans. While not anticipated for 2023, Corteva may make potential discretionary contributions to the principal U.S. pension plan. Corteva, furthermore, may be required to make significant contributions to its pension plans in the future, which could adversely affect Corteva&#8217;s results of operations, liquidity and financial condition. \\n\\nSentiment towards climate change and other environmental, social and governance (&#8220;ESG&#8221;) matters could adversely affect our stock price, results of operations, and access to capital. \\n\\nSince 2020, Corteva has announced sustainability goals, including adopting its greenhouse gas emission reduction strategy and targets for 2030 and inclusion, diversity and equity goals for 2026. Execution of these strategies and the achievements of Corteva&#8217;s sustainability goals is subject to risk and uncertainties, many of which are out of its control. Failure to achieve its sustainability goals within the currently projected costs and expected timeframes could damage Corteva&#8217;s reputation, customer and investor relationships, or its access to financing. Further, given investors\\' increased focus related to ESG matters, such a failure could cause stockholders to reduce their ownership holdings, all of which, in turn could adversely affect Corteva&#8217;s business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows and reduce its stock price. \\n\\nGlobal or regional health pandemics or epidemics, including COVID-19, could negatively impact the company\\'s business, financial condition and results of operations. \\n\\nCorteva\\'s business, financial condition, and results of operations could be negatively impacted by COVID-19 or other pandemics or epidemics. The severity, magnitude and duration of the pandemics and future outbreaks is uncertain, rapidly changing and difficult to predict. Increased market volatility resulting from COVID-19 disruptions has also limited the availability of certain manufacturing inputs. Current and future pandemics or epidemics and resulting illness, travel restrictions \\n\\nPart I \\n\\nITEM 1A. RISK FACTORS, continued \\n\\nand workforce disruptions could impact Corteva\\'s global supply chain, its operations and its routes to market or those of its suppliers, co-manufacturers, or customers/distributors. These disruptions or the company\\'s failure to effectively respond to them could increase product or distribution costs, alter the timing of recognizing manufacturing costs, or impact the delivery of products to customers. \\n\\nGovernment-pandemic or epidemic responses, including stay at home orders, can significantly impact other economic activity and markets around the world. Future outbreaks or pandemics could negatively impact the company\\'s business, financial condition, and results of operations in numerous ways, including but not limited to those outlined below: \\n\\n&#8226; Temporary disruptions to the company\\'s ability to operate or distribute its products in these markets. \\n\\n&#8226; Reductions to the company&#8217;s forecasted profitability and continued global economic decline could trigger potential impairment of the carrying value of goodwill or other indefinite and definite-lived intangible assets. \\n\\n&#8226; Increased risk of collection of the company\\'s customer receivables. \\n\\n&#8226; Increased market volatility that impacts the company\\'s hedging, financial forecasting, and liquidity, including its access to capital markets. \\n\\n&#8226; Delays or modifications to the company\\'s strategic plans and productivity initiatives. \\n\\nTherefore, the result of the company&#8217;s consolidated results of operations in face of another pandemic or epidemic, and the unprecedented economic conditions which can result therefrom may negatively impact the company\\'s business operations, financial performance and results of operations in the future. \\n\\n',\n",
       " 'Risks Related to Our Intellectual Property ': '\\n\\nEnforcing Corteva&#8217;s intellectual property rights, or defending against intellectual property claims asserted by others, could materially affect Corteva&#8217;s business, results of operations and financial condition. \\n\\nIntellectual property rights, including patents, plant variety protection, trade secrets, confidential information, trademarks, trade names and other forms of trade dress, are important to Corteva&#8217;s business. Corteva endeavors to protect its intellectual property rights in jurisdictions in which its products are produced or used and in jurisdictions into which its products are imported. However, Corteva may be unable to obtain protection for its intellectual property in key jurisdictions. Further, changes in government policies and regulations, including changes made in reaction to pressure from non-governmental organizations, or the public generally, could impact the extent of intellectual property protection afforded by such jurisdictions. \\n\\nCorteva has designed and implemented internal controls to restrict use of, access to and distribution of its intellectual property. Despite these precautions, Corteva&#8217;s intellectual property is vulnerable to infringement, misappropriation and other unauthorized access, including through employee or licensee error or actions, theft and cybersecurity incidents, and other security breaches. When unauthorized access and use or counterfeit products are discovered, Corteva reports such situations to governmental authorities for investigation, as appropriate, and takes measures to mitigate any potential impact. Protecting intellectual property related to biotechnology is particularly challenging because theft is difficult to detect and biotechnology can be self-replicating. \\n\\nCompetitors are increasingly challenging intellectual property positions and the outcomes can be highly uncertain. Third parties may claim Corteva&#8217;s products violate their intellectual property rights. Defending such claims, even those without merit, could be time-consuming and expensive. In addition, any such claim could result in Corteva&#8217;s having to enter into license agreements, develop non-infringing products or engage in litigation that could be costly. If challenges are resolved adversely, it could negatively impact Corteva&#8217;s ability to obtain licenses on competitive terms, develop and commercialize new products and generate sales from existing products. \\n\\nIn addition, because of the rapid pace of technological change, the confidentiality of patent applications in some jurisdictions and/or the uncertainty in predicting the outcome of complex proceedings relating to ownership and the scope of patents relating to certain emerging technologies, competitors may be issued patents related to Corteva&#8217;s business unexpectedly. These patents could reduce the value of Corteva&#8217;s commercial or pipeline products or, to the extent they cover key technologies on which Corteva has relied, require Corteva to seek to obtain licenses (and Corteva cannot ensure it would be able to obtain such a license on acceptable terms) or cease using the technology, no matter how valuable to Corteva&#8217;s business. \\n\\nPart I \\n\\nITEM 1A. RISK FACTORS, continued \\n\\nLegislation and jurisprudence on patent protection is evolving and changes in laws could affect Corteva&#8217;s ability to obtain or maintain patent protection for, and otherwise enforce Corteva&#8217;s patents related to, its products. \\n\\nCorteva&#8217;s business may be adversely affected by the availability of counterfeit products. \\n\\nA counterfeit product is one that has been deliberately and fraudulently mislabeled as to its identity and source. A counterfeit Corteva product, therefore, is one manufactured by someone other than Corteva, but which appears to be the same as an authentic Corteva product. The prevalence of counterfeit products is a significant and growing industry-wide issue due to a variety of factors, including, but not limited to, the following: the widespread use of the Internet, which has greatly facilitated the ease by which counterfeit products can be advertised, purchased and delivered to individual consumers; the availability of sophisticated technology that makes it easier for counterfeiters to make counterfeit products; and the relatively modest risk of penalties faced by counterfeiters compared to the large profits that can be earned by them from the sale of counterfeit products. Further, laws against counterfeiting vary greatly from country to country, and the enforcement of existing laws varies greatly from jurisdiction to jurisdiction. For example, in some countries, counterfeiting is not a crime; in others, it may result in only minimal sanctions. In addition, those involved in the distribution of counterfeit products use complex transport routes to evade customs controls by disguising the true source of their products. \\n\\nCorteva&#8217;s global reputation makes its products prime targets for counterfeiting organizations. Counterfeit products pose a risk to consumer health and safety because of the conditions under which they are manufactured (often in unregulated, unlicensed, uninspected and unsanitary sites) as well as the lack of regulation of their contents. Failure to mitigate the threat of counterfeit products, which is exacerbated by the complexity of the supply chain, could adversely impact Corteva&#8217;s business by, among other things, causing the loss of consumer confidence in Corteva&#8217;s name and in the integrity of its products, potentially resulting in lost sales and an increased threat of litigation. \\n\\nCorteva undertakes significant efforts to counteract the threats associated with counterfeit products, including, among other things, working with regulatory authorities and multinational coalitions to combat the counterfeiting of products and supporting efforts by law enforcement authorities to prosecute counterfeiters; assessing new and existing technologies to seek to make it more difficult for counterfeiters to copy Corteva&#8217;s products and easier for consumers to distinguish authentic from counterfeit products; working diligently to raise public awareness about the dangers of counterfeit products; working collaboratively with wholesalers, customs offices and law enforcement agencies to increase inspection coverage, monitor distribution channels and improve surveillance of distributors; and working with other members of an international trade association of agrochemical companies to promote initiatives to combat counterfeiting activity. No assurance can be given, however, that Corteva&#8217;s efforts and the efforts of others will be entirely successful, and the presence of counterfeit products may continue to increase. \\n\\nRestrictions under the intellectual property cross-license agreements limit Corteva&#8217;s ability to develop and commercialize certain products and services and/or prosecute, maintain and enforce certain intellectual property. \\n\\nThe company is dependent to a certain extent on DuPont and Dow to maintain and enforce certain of the intellectual property licensed under the Intellectual Property Cross-License Agreements. For example, DuPont and Dow are responsible for filing, prosecuting and maintaining (at their respective discretion) patents on trade secrets and know-how that they each respectively license to Corteva. They also have the first right to enforce their respective trade secrets and know-how licensed to Corteva. If DuPont or Dow, as applicable, fails to fulfill its obligations or chooses to not enforce the licensed patents, trade secrets or know-how under the Intellectual Property Cross-License Agreements, the company may not be able to prevent competitors from making, using and selling competitive products and services. \\n\\nIn addition, Corteva&#8217;s use of the intellectual property licensed to it under the Intellectual Property Cross-License Agreements is restricted to certain fields, which could limit Corteva&#8217;s ability to develop and commercialize certain products and services. For example, the licenses granted to Corteva under the agreement will not extend to all fields of use that the company may decide to enter into in the future. These restrictions may make it more difficult, time consuming and/or expensive for Corteva to develop and commercialize certain new products and services, or may result in certain of its products or services being later to market than those of its competitors. \\n\\nPart I \\n\\nITEM 1A. RISK FACTORS, continued \\n\\n',\n",
       " 'Risks Related to The Separation ': '\\n\\nIn connection with the Separation the company has assumed, and agreed to indemnify DuPont and Dow for, certain liabilities. If the company is required to make payments pursuant to these indemnities, the company may need to divert cash to meet those obligations and its financial results could be negatively impacted. In addition, DuPont and Dow will indemnify Corteva for certain liabilities. These indemnities may not be sufficient to insure the company against the full amount of liabilities it incurs, and DuPont and/or Dow, and/or their historical separated businesses, may not be able to satisfy their indemnification obligations in the future. \\n\\nPursuant to the Separation Agreement, the Employee Matters Agreement and the Tax Matters Agreement with DuPont and Dow, the company agreed to assume, and indemnify DuPont and Dow for, certain liabilities for uncapped amounts, which may include, among other items, associated defense costs, settlement amounts and judgments, as discussed further in Note 15 - Commitments and Contingent Liabilities, to the Consolidated Financial Statements and Part I - Item 3 - Legal Proceedings. Payments pursuant to these indemnities may be significant and could negatively impact the company&#8217;s business, particularly indemnities relating to certain litigation for Historical DuPont operations or its actions that could impact the tax-free nature of the Corteva Distribution. Third parties could also seek to hold the company responsible for any of the liabilities allocated to DuPont and Dow, including those related to DowDuPont&#8217;s specialty products and/or materials science businesses, respectively, and those related to discontinued and/or divested businesses and operations of Historical Dow, which have been allocated to Dow. DuPont and/or Dow, as applicable, will agree to indemnify Corteva for such liabilities, but such indemnities may not be sufficient to protect the company against the full amount of such liabilities. In addition, DuPont and/or Dow, as applicable, may not be able to fully satisfy their indemnification obligations with respect to the liabilities the company incurs. Even if the company ultimately succeeds in recovering from DuPont and/or Dow, as applicable, any amounts for which the company is held liable, the company may be temporarily required to bear these losses itself. Each of these risks could negatively affect the company&#8217;s business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows. \\n\\nAdditionally, the company generally has assumed and is responsible for the payment of its share of (i) certain liabilities of DowDuPont relating to, arising out of or resulting from certain general corporate matters of DowDuPont, (ii) certain liabilities of Historical DuPont relating to, arising out of or resulting from general corporate matters of Historical DuPont and discontinued and/or divested businesses and operations of Historical DuPont, including its spin-off of Chemours, and (iii) certain separation expenses not otherwise allocated to DuPont or Dow (or allocated specifically to Corteva) pursuant to the Corteva Separation Agreement, and third parties could seek to hold Corteva responsible for DuPont&#8217;s or Dow&#8217;s share of any such liabilities. For more information, see Note 15 - Commitments and Contingent Liabilities, to the Consolidated Financial Statements and Part I - Item 3 - Legal Proceedings. DuPont and/or Dow, as applicable, will indemnify Corteva for their share of any such liabilities; however, such indemnities may not be sufficient to protect Corteva against the full amount of such liabilities, and/or DuPont and/or Dow may not be able to fully satisfy their respective indemnification obligations. In addition, even if the company ultimately succeeds in recovering from DuPont and/or Dow any amounts for which the company is held liable in excess of its agreed share, the company may be temporarily required to bear these losses itself and may not be able to fully insure itself to cover these risks. Each of these risks could materially affect the company&#8217;s business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows. \\n\\nThe Separation and related transactions may expose Corteva to potential liabilities arising out of state and federal fraudulent conveyance laws \\n\\nAlthough the company received a solvency opinion from an investment bank confirming that the company and DuPont were each adequately capitalized following the Distribution, the Separation could be challenged under various state and federal fraudulent conveyance laws. In connection with fraudulent conveyances or transfers are generally defined to include transfers made or obligations incurred with the actual intent to hinder, delay or defraud current or future creditors or transfers made or obligations incurred for less than reasonably equivalent value when the debtor was insolvent, or that rendered the debtor insolvent, inadequately capitalized or unable to pay its debts as they become due. Any unpaid creditor could claim that DuPont did not receive fair consideration or reasonably equivalent value in the Separation and Corteva Distribution, and that the Separation and Corteva Distribution left DuPont insolvent or with unreasonably small capital or that DuPont intended or believed it would incur debts beyond its ability to pay such debts as they matured. Additionally, under its indemnity provisions of the Separation Agreement, the company could find its liabilities increased as a result of a court concluding that Historical DuPont, Historical Dow or DowDuPont executed a fraudulent conveyance in connection with divestitures and spin-offs of any one of their historical operations, including Chemours. If a court were to agree with such a plaintiff, then such court could void the Separation and Distribution as a fraudulent transfer or impose substantial liabilities on Corteva, which could materially \\n\\nPart I \\n\\nITEM 1A. RISK FACTORS, continued \\n\\nadversely affect its financial condition and results of operations. Among other things, the court could return some of Corteva&#8217;s assets or shares of Corteva common stock to DuPont, provide DuPont with a claim for money damages against Corteva in an amount equal to the difference between the consideration received by DuPont and the fair market value of Corteva at the time of the Corteva Distribution, or require Corteva to fund liabilities of other companies involved in the Internal Reorganization for the benefit of creditors. \\n\\nThe Distribution is also subject to review under state corporate Distribution statutes. Under the Delaware General Corporation Law (the &#8220;DGCL&#8221;), a corporation may only pay dividends to its stockholders either (i) out of its surplus (net assets minus capital) or (ii) if there is no such surplus, out of its net profits for the fiscal year in which the dividend is declared and/or the preceding fiscal year. Although the Distribution was made out of DowDuPont&#8217;s surplus and the company received an opinion that DowDuPont has adequate surplus under Delaware law to declare the dividend of Corteva common stock in connection with the Corteva Distribution, there can be no assurance that a court will not later determine that some or all of the Corteva Distribution was unlawful. \\n\\nIf the Corteva Distribution or Merger, together with certain related transactions, were to fail to qualify for non-recognition treatment for U.S. federal income tax purposes, then the company could be subject to significant tax and indemnification liability and stockholders receiving Corteva common stock in the Corteva Distribution could be subject to significant tax and indemnification liability. \\n\\nDowDuPont received an IRS Tax Ruling and tax opinion that, among other things, the Corteva Distribution and certain related transactions will qualify as a tax-free transaction under Section 355 and Section 368(a)(1)(D) of the Internal Revenue Code (the \"Code). The IRS Ruling and tax opinion relied on certain facts, assumptions, and undertakings, and certain representations from DowDuPont and Corteva, regarding the past and future conduct of both respective businesses and other matters. Despite the tax opinion and the IRS Ruling, the IRS could determine on audit that the Distribution or certain related transactions should be treated as a taxable transaction if it determines that any of these facts, assumptions, representations or undertakings are not correct or have been violated, or that the Distribution should be taxable for other reasons, including if the IRS were to disagree with the conclusions of the tax opinion. \\n\\nIf the Distributions fail to qualify for non-recognition treatment for U.S. federal income tax purposes for certain reasons relating to the overall structure of the Merger and the Distributions, then under the Tax Matters Agreement, the company and DuPont would share any liabilities of DuPont in accordance with its relative equity values on the first full trading day following the Corteva Distribution. Furthermore, under the terms of the Tax Matters Agreement, the company also generally will be responsible for any taxes imposed on DuPont or Dow that arise from the failure of the Corteva Distribution to qualify as tax-free for U.S. federal income tax purposes within the meaning of Section 355 of the Code or the failure of certain related transactions to qualify for tax-free treatment, to the extent such failure to qualify is attributable to actions, events or transactions relating to its, or its affiliates&#8217;, stock, assets or business, or any breach of its representations made in any representation letter provided to its counsel in connection with the tax opinion. DuPont and Dow will be separately responsible for any taxes imposed on Corteva that arise from the failure of the Corteva Distribution to qualify as tax-free for U.S. federal income tax purposes within the meaning of Section 355 of the Code or the failure of certain related transactions to qualify for tax-free treatment, to the extent such failure to qualify is attributable to actions, events or transactions relating to such company&#8217;s or its affiliates&#8217; stock, assets or business, or any breach of such company&#8217;s representations made in connection with the IRS Ruling or in the representation letter provided to counsel in connection with the tax opinion. \\n\\nEvents triggering an indemnification obligation under the tax matters agreement include events occurring after the Corteva Distribution that cause DuPont to recognize a gain under Section 355(e) of the Code, if, as a result of the Merger or other transactions considered part of a plan with the Distributions, there is a 50 percent or greater change of ownership in DuPont or Corteva. In connection with the Merger, DowDuPont received a private letter ruling from the IRS and tax opinion regarding the proper time, manner and methodology for measuring common ownership in the stock of DowDuPont, Historical DuPont and Historical Dow for purposes of determining whether there has been a 50 percent or greater change of ownership under Section 355(e) of the Code as a result of the Merger. Notwithstanding the conclusions of the IRS Ruling and the tax opinion that there was not a 50 percent or greater change of ownership in DowDuPont, Historical DuPont or Historical Dow for purposes of Section 355(e) as a result of the Merger, the IRS could determine that the Distributions or a related transaction should nevertheless be treated as a taxable transaction to DuPont if it determines that any of the facts, assumptions, representations or undertakings of DowDuPont is not correct or that the Distributions should be taxable for other reasons. If DuPont is required to recognize corporate level tax on either of the Distributions and certain related transactions under Section 355(e) of the Code, then under the Tax Matters Agreement, the company may be required to indemnify DuPont and/or Dow for all or a portion of \\n\\nPart I \\n\\nITEM 1A. RISK FACTORS, continued \\n\\nsuch taxes, which could be a material amount, if such taxes were the result of either direct or indirect transfers of Corteva common stock or certain reasons relating to the overall structure of the Merger and the Distributions. To the extent that the company is responsible for any tax or indemnification liability under the Tax Matters Agreement, there could be a material adverse impact on Corteva&#8217;s business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows in future reporting periods. \\n\\nThe company is subject to continuing contingent tax-related liabilities of DowDuPont following the Distribution. \\n\\nThere are several significant areas where the liabilities of DowDuPont may become Corteva&#8217;s obligations either in whole or in part. For example, under the Code and the related rules and regulations, each corporation that was a member of DowDuPont&#8217;s consolidated tax reporting group during any taxable period or portion of any taxable period ending on or before the effective time of the Distribution is jointly and severally liable for the U.S. federal income tax liability of the entire consolidated tax reporting group for such taxable period. Additionally, to the extent that any subsidiary of Corteva was included in the consolidated tax reporting group of either Historical DuPont or Historical Dow for any taxable period or portion of any taxable period ending on or before the effective date of the Merger, such subsidiary is jointly and severally liable for the U.S. federal income tax liability of the entire consolidated tax reporting group of Historical DuPont or Historical Dow, as applicable, for such taxable period. In connection with the Distributions, on April 1, 2019, the company entered into the Tax Matters Agreement with DuPont and Dow that allocates the responsibility for prior period consolidated taxes among Corteva, DuPont and Dow. If DuPont or Dow were unable to pay any prior period taxes for which it is responsible, however, the company could be required to pay the entire amount of such taxes, and such amounts could be significant. Other provisions of federal, state, local, or foreign law may establish similar liability for other matters, including laws governing tax-qualified pension plans, as well as other contingent liabilities. \\n\\nPart I \\n\\n'}"

       "{'Risks Related to Our Regulatory Compliance': '\\n\\nOur business may be adversely affected by impacts on the availability and prices of raw materials and energy supplies, volatility in foreign exchange and interest rates, and other effects of the conflict between Russia and Ukraine. \\n\\nOur business may be adversely affected by the effects of the ongoing conflict between Russia and Ukraine. Although our operations in Russia and Ukraine accounted for less than one half of one percent of our net sales in fiscal year 2022, the region is a source of raw material and energy supply for both us and certain companies whose products we distribute. Economic sanctions and export control measures imposed on Russia and designated Russian enterprises, Belarus and certain regions of Ukraine have resulted in increased volatility in the availability and prices of such raw materials and energy supplies. In addition, sanctions and macroeconomic effects of the conflict have contributed to greater volatility in foreign exchange and interest rates that affect our financial results. Developments relating to the conflict might result in a continuation of these impacts and in other impacts that could adversely affect our business or results of operations. \\n\\nChanges in consumer preferences and perceptions may lessen the demand for our products, which could reduce our sales and profitability and harm our business. \\n\\nFood products are often affected by changes in consumer tastes, national, regional and local economic conditions and demographic trends. For instance, changes in prevailing health or dietary preferences causing consumers to avoid food products containing sweetener products, including high fructose corn syrup, in favor of foods that are perceived as being healthier, could materially reduce our sales and profitability. Increasing concern among consumers, public health professionals and government agencies about the potential health concerns associated with obesity and inactive lifestyles (reflected, for instance, in taxes on certain beverages designed to combat obesity, which have been imposed recently in North America) represent a significant cost to some of our customers, including those engaged in the food and soft drink industries, and could materially affect demand for our products. \\n\\nCurrent economic conditions may adversely impact demand for our products, reduce access to credit, affect investment returns and cause our customers and others with whom we do business to suffer financial hardship, all of which could adversely impact our business, results of operations, financial condition and cash flows. \\n\\nGeneral business and economic conditions that could affect us include barriers to trade (including as a result of tariffs, duties and border taxes, among other factors), the strength of the economies in which we operate, unemployment, inflation and fluctuations in debt markets. While currently these conditions have not impaired our ability to access credit markets and finance our operations, we are subject to the risk of a further deterioration in the financial markets. \\n\\nThese economic developments could have a number of other effects on our business, including reduced consumer demand for products, pressure to extend our customers&#8217; payment terms, insolvency of our customers resulting in increased \\n\\nprovisions for credit losses, decreased customer demand, including order delays or cancellations and counterparty failures negatively impacting our operations. \\n\\nIn connection with our defined benefit pension plans, adverse changes in investment returns earned on pension assets and discount rates used to calculate pension and related liabilities or changes in required pension funding levels may have an unfavorable impact on future pension expenses and cash flows. \\n\\nVolatile worldwide economic conditions and market instability may make it difficult for us, our customers and our suppliers to accurately forecast future product demand trends, which could cause us to produce products in excess of demand and increase our inventory carrying costs. Alternatively, this forecasting difficulty may cause a shortage of products that could affect our ability to satisfy the demand for our products. \\n\\nOur reliance on certain industries for a significant portion of our sales could have a material adverse effect on our business. \\n\\nOf our 2022 net sales, approximately 54 percent were generated by sales to the food industry, 11 percent by sales to the animal nutrition industry, 8 percent by sales to the beverage industry, and 8 percent by sales to the brewing industry. If our customers in any of these industries were to substantially decrease their purchases, our business might be materially adversely affected. \\n\\nThe coronavirus 19 disease (\"COVID 19\") pandemic could have a material adverse effect on our business. \\n\\nThe ongoing COVID-19 pandemic has had, and could continue to have, negative impacts on our business, including causing significant volatility in the commodity and currency markets, changes in consumer demand, behavior or preference, disruptions in our supply chain and manufacturing capacity, limitations on our employees\\' ability to work and changes in the economic or political conditions in markets we serve which could constrain or halt shipments to customers. These risks individually and in the aggregate could have a material effect on our operating results, financial condition, cash flows and prospects. \\n\\nThe uncertainty of acceptance of products developed through biotechnology could affect our profitability. \\n\\nThe commercial success of agricultural products developed through biotechnology, including genetically modified corn, depends in part on public acceptance of their development, cultivation, distribution and consumption. Public attitudes can be influenced by claims that genetically modified products are unsafe for consumption or that they pose unknown risks to the environment, even if such claims are not based on scientific studies. These public attitudes can influence regulatory and legislative decisions about biotechnology. The sale of our products, which may contain genetically modified corn, could be delayed or impeded because of adverse public perception regarding the safety of our products and the potential effects of these products on human health, the environment and animals. \\n\\nOur future growth could be negatively impacted if we fail to continue introducing innovative new products and services. \\n\\nA significant portion of our growth depends on innovation in products, processes and services. Our R&#38;D efforts may not result in new products and services at a rate or of a quality sufficient to gain market acceptance. \\n\\nIt may be difficult to preserve operating margins and maintain market share in the highly competitive environment in which we operate. \\n\\nWe operate in a highly competitive environment. Competition in markets in which we compete is largely based on price, quality and product availability. Many of our products compete with virtually identical or similar products manufactured by other companies in the starch and sweetener industry. In the U.S., our competitors include divisions of larger enterprises that have greater financial resources than we do. Some of these competitors, unlike us, have vertically integrated their corn refining and other operations. Many of our products also compete with products made from raw materials other than corn, including cane and beet sugar. Fluctuation in prices of these competing products may affect prices of, and profits derived from, our products. In addition, government programs supporting sugar prices indirectly impact the price of corn sweeteners, especially high fructose corn syrup. Furthermore, co-products such as corn oil and gluten meal compete with products of the corn dry milling industry and with soybean oil, soybean meal and other products, the price of some of which may be affected by government programs such as tariffs or quotas. \\n\\nDue to market volatility, we may be unable to pass potential increases in the cost of corn and other raw materials on to customers through product price increases, to purchase quantities of corn and other raw materials at prices sufficient to sustain or increase our profitability, or to supply product quantities and meet shipment delivery requirements that our customers demand. \\n\\nThe price and availability of corn and other raw materials are subject to volatility as a result of economic and industry conditions, including supply and demand factors such as supply chain disruptions, crop disease and severe weather conditions that include drought, floods, frost and ocean currents. These conditions are difficult to anticipate, are beyond our control and could adversely impact our profitability by affecting the prices we pay for raw materials. \\n\\nInputs to our procurement, production processes and delivery channels, such as raw material, energy, and freight and logistics, may experience price fluctuations, supply chain interruptions, and shortages that could adversely affect our results of operations. \\n\\nOur finished products are made primarily from corn. Purchased corn and other raw material costs generally account for between 40 percent and 60 percent of our finished product costs. Some of our products are based upon specific varieties of corn that are produced in significantly smaller volumes than yellow dent corn. These specialty grains cost more due to their more limited availability and require planning cycles of up to three years to ensure we receive an adequate supply. We also manufacture certain starch-based products from potatoes. Our current potato starch requirements constitute a material portion of the total available North American supply. It is possible that, in the long term, continued growth in demand for potato starch-based ingredients and new product development could result in capacity constraints. Also, we utilize tapioca in the manufacturing of starch products primarily in Thailand, as well as pulses, gum, rice, stevia and other raw materials around the world. A significant supply disruption or sharp increase in prices of any of these raw materials that we are unable to recover through pricing increases to our customers could have an adverse impact on our growth and profitability, especially if such an event disproportionately affects us as compared to our competitors. \\n\\nOur business could be adversely affected by fluctuations in our energy costs, which represented approximately 7 percent of our finished product costs in 2022. We use energy primarily to create steam required for our production processes and to dry products. We consume natural gas, electricity, coal, fuel oil, wood and other biomass sources to generate energy. \\n\\nBecause we ship products worldwide, our business could be adversely affected by fluctuations in freight and logistics costs, and disruptions in supply channels between parties and locations that include our suppliers, production and storage facilities, tolling and packaging partners, distributors and customers. Risks to our business include impacts from labor strikes or weather-related events that affect transportation by rail, air, shipping or mobile transport. \\n\\nThe market prices for our raw materials, supply chain freight and logistics, and energy may vary considerably depending on supply and demand, world economies, trade agreements and tariffs and other factors. We purchase these commodities and services based on our anticipated usage and future outlook for these costs. We may not be able to purchase these commodities and services at prices that we can adequately pass on to customers, which could have an adverse impact on our growth and profitability. \\n\\nIn North America, we sell a large portion of our finished products derived from corn at firm prices established in supply contracts typically lasting for a period of one year. To minimize the effect of volatility in the cost of corn related to these firm-priced supply contracts, we enter into corn futures and options contracts, or take other hedging positions in the corn futures market. These derivative contracts typically mature within one year. At expiration, we settle the derivative contracts at a net amount equal to the difference between the then-current price of the commodity and the derivative contract price. The fluctuations in the fair value of these hedging instruments may adversely affect our cash flow. We fund any unrealized losses or receive cash for any unrealized gains on futures contracts on a daily basis. While the corn futures contracts or hedging positions are intended to minimize the effect of volatility of corn costs on operating profits, the hedging activity can result in losses, some of which may be material. In addition, our hedging activities may not be fully successful in limiting the effect of volatility in the cost of corn. \\n\\nAn inability to contain costs could adversely affect our future profitability and growth. \\n\\nOur future profitability and growth depend on our ability to contain operating costs and per unit product costs and to maintain and implement effective cost control programs, while also maintaining competitive pricing and superior quality products, customer service and support. Our ability to maintain a competitive cost structure depends on continued \\n\\ncontainment of manufacturing, delivery and administrative costs, as well as the implementation of cost-effective purchasing programs for raw materials, energy and related manufacturing requirements. \\n\\nIf we are unable to contain our operating costs and maintain the productivity and reliability of our production facilities, our profitability and growth could be adversely affected. \\n\\nOperating difficulties at our manufacturing facilities and liabilities relating to product safety and quality could adversely affect our operating results. \\n\\nProducing starches and sweeteners through corn refining is a capital-intensive industry. We conduct preventive maintenance and de-bottlenecking programs at our manufacturing facilities designed to maintain and improve grind capacity and facility reliability. If we encounter operating difficulties at a facility for an extended period of time or start-up problems with any capital improvement projects, we may not be able to meet a portion of our sales order commitments and could incur significantly higher operating expenses, both of which could adversely affect our operating results. Furthermore, we use boilers to generate steam required in our production processes. An event that impaired the operation of a boiler for an extended period of time could have a significant adverse effect on the operations of any manufacturing facility in which such event occurred. \\n\\nIn addition, we are subject to risks related to such matters as product safety and quality and customer product liability claims. The liabilities that could result from these risks may not always be covered by, or could exceed the limits of, our insurance coverage related to product liability and food safety matters. In addition, negative publicity caused by product liability and food safety matters may damage our reputation. The occurrence of any of the matters described above could adversely affect our revenues and operating results. \\n\\nGlobal climate change and legal, regulatory, or market measures to address climate change, may negatively affect our business, operations and financial results. \\n\\nWe are subject to risks associated with the long-term effects of climate change on the global economy and on our industry in particular. Extreme weather and natural disasters within or outside the United States, such as drought, wildfires, storms, changes in ocean currents and flooding, could make it more difficult and costly for us to manufacture and deliver our products to our customers, obtain raw materials from our suppliers, or perform other critical corporate functions. In particular, if such climate change impacts negatively affect agricultural productivity, we may be subject to decreased availability or less favorable pricing from certain commodities that are necessary for our products, such as corn, specialty grains, rice, stevia, peas and sugar. Adverse weather conditions and natural disasters could reduce crop size and crop quality, which could reduce our supplies of raw materials, lower recoveries of usable raw materials, increase the prices of our raw materials, increase our costs of storing and transporting raw materials, or disrupt production schedules. Our manufacturing operations also could be adversely affected by reduced water availability resulting from droughts. \\n\\nThere is a growing societal concern that carbon dioxide and other greenhouse gases in the atmosphere may have an adverse effect on global temperatures, weather patterns and the frequency and severity of natural disasters. The increasing concern over climate change could result in new domestic or international legal requirements for us to reduce greenhouse gas emissions and other environmental impacts of our operations, improve our energy efficiency, or undertake sustainability measures that exceed those we currently pursue. Furthermore, such measures may result in the taxation of greenhouse gas emissions. Any such regulatory requirements could cause disruptions in the manufacture of our products and result in increased capital, procurement, manufacturing and distribution costs. Our reputation and brand could be harmed if we fail, or are seen as having failed, to respond responsibly and effectively to changes in legal and regulatory measures adopted to address climate change. \\n\\nIn addition, changing customer preferences may result in increased demands regarding packaging materials and other components in our products and their environmental impact on sustainability. Further, customers may place increasing importance on purchasing products that are sustainably grown and made, requiring us to incur additional costs for increased due diligence and reporting. These demands may cause us to incur additional costs or make other changes to other operations to respond to such demands, which could adversely affect our financial results. \\n\\nWe may not successfully identify and complete acquisitions or strategic alliances on favorable terms or achieve anticipated synergies relating to any acquisitions or alliances, and such transactions could result in unforeseen operating difficulties and expenditures and require significant management resources. \\n\\nWe regularly review potential acquisitions of complementary businesses, technologies, services, or products, as well as potential strategic alliances. We may be unable to find suitable acquisition candidates or appropriate partners with which to form partnerships or strategic alliances. Even if we identify appropriate acquisition or alliance candidates, we may be unable to complete such acquisitions or alliances on favorable terms, or at all. In addition, the process of integrating an acquired business, technology, service, or product into our existing business and operations may result in unforeseen operating difficulties and expenditures. Integration of an acquired company may also require significant management resources that otherwise would be available for ongoing development of our business. Moreover, we may not realize the anticipated benefits of any acquisition or strategic alliance and such transactions may not generate anticipated financial results. Future acquisitions could also require us to issue equity securities, incur debt, assume contingent liabilities, or amortize expenses related to intangible assets, any of which could harm our business. \\n\\nWe operate a multinational business subject to the economic, political and other risks inherent in conducting operations in foreign countries and with foreign currencies. \\n\\nWe have operated in foreign countries and with foreign currencies for many years, and our results are subject to foreign currency exchange fluctuations. We primarily sell products derived from world commodities. Historically, we have been able to adjust local prices relatively quickly to offset the effect of local currency depreciation versus the U.S. dollar, although we cannot guarantee our ability to do this in the future. The anticipated strength in the U.S. dollar may continue to involve risks, as it could take us an extended period of time to fully recapture the impact of a loss of foreign currency value versus the U.S. dollar. We may hedge transactions that are denominated in a currency other than the currency of the operating unit entering into the underlying transaction. Our hedging activities may not be fully successful in limiting the adverse impacts of our currency risks . \\n\\nOur operations are subject to political, economic and other risks. There has been and continues to be significant political uncertainty in some countries in which we operate. Economic changes, terrorist activity and political unrest may result in business interruption or decreased demand for our products. Country capital controls, such as those in Pakistan, may prevent the repatriation of dividends from owned entities in the country. Protectionist trade measures and import and export licensing requirements could also adversely affect our results of operations. \\n\\nOur profitability could be negatively impacted if we fail to maintain satisfactory labor relations. \\n\\nWe have employees domiciled in the U.S. as well as worldwide who belong to labor unions. Strikes, lockouts, or other work stoppages or slowdowns involving our unionized employees, or attempts to organize for collective bargaining purposes among non-unionized employees, could have a material adverse effect on our business. For example, from September 2022 to January 2023, we experienced a strike involving approximately 103 employees at our production facility in Cedar Rapids, Iowa, although this incident did not have a material impact on our business. \\n\\nThe inability for us to attract, develop, retain, motivate, and maintain good relationships with our workforce, including key personnel, could negatively impact our business and our profitability. \\n\\nOur future success depends on our ability to attract, develop, retain, motivate, and maintain good relationships with qualified personnel, particularly those who have extensive expertise in the ingredients solutions industry and who may also have long service with our company. Such personnel are members of our senior executive leadership and work in key areas throughout our U.S. and international operations such as manufacturing, sales, and innovation, all of which are critical to our future growth and profitability. We face intensive competition in retaining and hiring individuals with the requisite expertise, both within and outside the ingredients solutions industry, including from companies that have greater resources than we do. \\n\\nChanges in labor markets as a result of COVID-19 and other socioeconomic and demographic changes, have increased the competition for hiring and retaining talent. As a result of this competition, we may be unable to continue to attract, develop, retain, motivate, and maintain good relationships with suitably qualified individuals at acceptable compensation levels who have the managerial, operational, and technical knowledge and experience to meet our needs. Furthermore, any failure by us to manage internal succession or to effectively transfer knowledge from departing employees to others in the organization could adversely affect our business and results of operations. Even if we succeed in \\n\\nhiring new personnel to fill vacancies, lengthy training and orientation periods might be required before new employees are able to achieve acceptable productivity levels. Any failure by us to attract, develop, retain, motivate, and maintain good relationships with qualified individuals could adversely affect our business and results of operations. \\n\\nNatural disasters, war, acts and threats of terrorism, pandemics and other significant events could negatively impact our business. \\n\\nThe economies of any countries in which we sell or manufacture products or purchase raw materials could be affected by natural disasters. Such natural disasters could include, among others, earthquakes, floods, or severe weather conditions; war, acts of war or terrorism; or the outbreak of an epidemic or pandemic such as COVID-19. Any such event could result in disruptions to operations, asset write-offs, decreased sales and overall reduced cash flows. The impacts of COVID-19 adversely affected our results of operations in periods since the first quarter of 2020. \\n\\nThe recognition of impairment charges on goodwill or long-lived assets could adversely impact our future financial position and results of operations. \\n\\nWe have $1.3 billion of total net intangible assets as of December 31, 2022, consisting of $900 million of goodwill and $401 million of other net intangible assets, which constitute 12 percent and 5 percent, respectively, of our total assets as of such date. Additionally, we have approximately $2.9 billion of long-lived assets, or 39 percent of our total assets, as of December 31, 2022. \\n\\nWe perform an annual impairment assessment for goodwill and our indefinite-lived intangible assets and as necessary for other long-lived assets. If the results of such assessments were to show that the fair value of these assets were less than the carrying values, we could be required to recognize a charge for impairment of goodwill or long-lived assets, which could be material. \\n\\nThe future occurrence of a potential indicator of impairment, such as a significant adverse change in the business climate that would require a change in our assumptions or strategic decisions made in response to economic or competitive conditions, could require us to perform an assessment prior to the next required assessment date of July 1, 2023. \\n\\nOur profitability may be affected by other factors beyond our control. \\n\\nOur operating income and ability to sustain or increase profitability depend to a large extent upon our ability to price finished products at a level that will cover manufacturing and raw material costs and provide an acceptable profit margin. Our ability to maintain appropriate price levels is determined by a number of factors largely beyond our control, such as aggregate industry supply and market demand, which may vary from time to time, and the economic conditions of the geographic regions in which we conduct our operations.

      "acquisitions: ['A company’s internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. A company’s internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that (i) pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company; (ii) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the company; and (iii) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the company’s assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements. ', \"Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate. \\n\\nCritical Audit Matters \\n\\nThe critical audit matters communicated below are matters arising from the current period audit of the consolidated financial statements that were communicated or required to be communicated to the audit committee and that (i) relate to accounts or disclosures that are material to the consolidated financial statements and (ii) involved our especially challenging, subjective, or complex judgments. The communication of critical audit matters does not alter in any way our opinion on the consolidated financial statements, taken as a whole, and we are not, by communicating the critical audit matters below, providing separate opinions on the critical audit matters or on the accounts or disclosures to which they relate. \\n\\nGoodwill Impairment Assessments \\n\\nAs described in Notes 2 and 8 to the consolidated financial statements, the Company’s consolidated goodwill balance was $30.8 billion as of December 31, 2022. Historically, management tested reporting units for impairment annually as of the first day of the second quarter, or more frequently if events or circumstances indicate it is more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying amount. Beginning in the third quarter of 2022 and for subsequent annual periods, management voluntarily changed the annual impairment assessment date to the first day of the third quarter. Reporting units are tested for impairment by comparing the estimated fair value of each reporting unit with its carrying amount. If the carrying amount of a reporting unit exceeds its estimated fair value, an impairment loss is recorded based on the difference between the fair value and carrying amount, not to exceed the associated carrying amount of goodwill. Management recognized non-cash goodwill impairment losses of $444 million for the year ended December 31, 2022. Management utilizes the discounted cash flow method under the income approach to estimate the fair value of reporting units. As disclosed by management, management’s cash flow projections included significant assumptions related to net sales, cost of products sold, selling, general, and administrative costs (SG&A), depreciation and amortization, working capital, capital expenditures, income tax rates, discount rates, long-term growth rates, and other market factors. \\n\\nThe principal considerations for our determination that performing procedures relating to the goodwill impairment assessments is a critical audit matter are (i) the significant judgment by management when developing the fair value of the reporting units; (ii) a high degree of auditor judgment, subjectivity, and effort in performing procedures and evaluating management’s significant assumptions related to net sales, cost of products sold, SG&A, discount rates, and long-term growth rates; and (iii) the audit effort involved the use of professionals with specialized skill and knowledge. \\n\\nAddressing the matter involved performing procedures and evaluating audit evidence in connection with forming our overall opinion on the consolidated financial statements. These procedures included testing the effectiveness of controls relating to management’s goodwill impairment assessments, including controls over the valuation of the Company’s reporting units. These procedures also included, among others (i) testing management’s process for developing the fair value of the reporting units; (ii) evaluating the appropriateness of the discounted cash flow method; (iii) testing the completeness and accuracy of underlying data used in the method; and (iv) evaluating the significant assumptions related to net sales, cost of products sold, SG&A, discount rates and long-term growth rates. Evaluating management’s assumptions related to net sales, cost of products sold, SG&A, discount rates and long-term growth rates involved evaluating whether the assumptions used by management were reasonable considering (i) the current and past performance of the reporting unit; (ii) the consistency with external market and industry data; and (iii) whether these assumptions were consistent with evidence obtained in other areas of the audit. Professionals with specialized skill and knowledge were used to assist in the evaluation of (i) the Company’s discounted cash flow method and (ii) the discount rate and long-term growth rate assumptions. \\n\\nIndefinite-Lived Intangible Assets Impairment Assessments \\n\\nAs described in Notes 2 and 8 to the consolidated financial statements, the Company’s consolidated indefinite-lived intangible assets balance, which consists primarily of individual brands, was $38.6 billion as of December 31, 2022. Historically, management tested brands for impairment annually as of the first day of the second quarter, or more frequently if events or circumstances indicate it is more likely than not that the fair value of a brand is less than its carrying amount. Beginning in the third quarter of 2022 and for subsequent annual periods, management voluntarily changed the annual impairment assessment date to the first day of the third quarter. Brands are tested for impairment by comparing the estimated fair value of each brand with its carrying amount. If the carrying amount of a brand exceeds its estimated fair value, an impairment loss is recorded based on the difference between the fair value and carrying amount. Management recognized non-cash indefinite-lived intangible asset impairment losses of $462 million for the year ended December 31, 2022. As disclosed by management, management utilizes either an excess earnings method or relief from royalty method to estimate the fair value of its brands. Using the excess earnings method, management’s cash flow projections included significant assumptions relating to net sales, cost of products sold, SG&A, contributory asset charges, income tax considerations, long-term growth rates, discount rates, and other market factors. Using the relief from royalty method, management’s cash flow projections included significant assumptions related to net sales, royalty rates, income tax considerations, long-term growth rates, discount rates, and other market factors. \\n\\nThe principal considerations for our determination that performing procedures relating to the indefinite-lived intangible assets impairment assessment is a critical audit matter are (i) the significant judgment by management when developing the fair value of the brands; (ii) a high degree of auditor judgment, subjectivity, and effort in performing procedures and evaluating management’s significant assumptions related to net sales, cost of products sold, SG&A, long-term growth rates and discount rates for the excess earnings method and net sales, royalty rates, long-term growth rates and discount rates for the relief from royalty method; and (iii) the audit effort involved the use of professionals with specialized skill and knowledge. \\n\\nAddressing the matter involved performing procedures and evaluating audit evidence in connection with forming our overall opinion on the consolidated financial statements. These procedures included testing the effectiveness of controls relating to management’s indefinite-lived intangible assets impairment assessment, including controls over the valuation of the Company’s indefinite-lived intangible assets. These procedures also included, among others (i) testing management’s process for developing the fair value of the brands; (ii) evaluating the appropriateness of the excess earnings and relief from royalty methods; (iii) testing the completeness and accuracy of underlying data used in the methods; and (iv) evaluating the significant assumptions used by management related to net sales, cost of products sold, SG&A, long-term growth rates and discount rates for the excess earnings method and net sales, royalty rates, long-term growth rates and discount rates for the relief from royalty method. Evaluating management’s assumptions related to net sales, cost of products sold, SG&A, long-term growth rates and discount rates for the excess earnings method and net sales, royalty rates, long-term growth rates and discount rates for the relief from royalty method involved evaluating whether the assumptions used by management were reasonable considering (i) the current and past performance of the individual brands; (ii) the consistency with external market and industry data; and (iii) whether these assumptions were consistent with evidence obtained in other areas of the audit. Professionals with specialized skill and knowledge were used to assist in the evaluation of (i) the Company’s excess earnings and relief from royalty methods and (ii) the royalty rate for the relief from royalty method and long-term growth rate and discount rate assumptions for the excess earnings method and relief from royalty method. \\n\\n/s/ PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP \\n\\nChicago, Illinois

\\n\\nNote 1. Basis of Presentation \\n\\nOrganization \", 'On July 2, 2015 (the “2015 Merger Date”), through a series of transactions, we consummated the merger of Kraft Foods Group, Inc. (“Kraft”) with and into a wholly-owned subsidiary of H.J. Heinz Holding Corporation (“Heinz”) (the “2015 Merger”). At the closing of the 2015 Merger, Heinz was renamed The Kraft Heinz Company. Before the consummation of the 2015 Merger, Heinz was controlled by Berkshire Hathaway Inc. and 3G Global Food Holdings, LP, following their acquisition of H. J. Heinz Company on June 7, 2013 (the “2013 Heinz Acquisition”). ', 'We operate on a 52- or 53-week fiscal year ending on the last Saturday in December in each calendar year. Unless the context requires otherwise, references to years and quarters contained herein pertain to our fiscal years and fiscal quarters. Our 2022 fiscal year was a 53-week period that ended on December 31, 2022, our 2021 fiscal year was a 52-week period that ended on December 25, 2021, and our 2020 fiscal year was a 52-week period that ended on December 26, 2020. \\n\\nPrinciples of Consolidation \\n\\nThe consolidated financial statements include The Kraft Heinz Company and all of our controlled subsidiaries. All intercompany transactions are eliminated. \\n\\nReportable Segments \\n\\nIn the second quarter of 2022, our internal reporting and reportable segments changed. We combined our United States and Canada zones to form the North America zone as a result of previously announced organizational changes, which are intended to advance and support our long-term growth plans by streamlining and synergizing our United States and Canada businesses. Subsequently, we manage and report our operating results through two reportable segments defined by geographic region: North America and International. We have reflected this change in all historical periods presented. \\n\\nUse of Estimates \\n\\nWe prepare our consolidated financial statements in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America (“U.S. GAAP”), which requires us to make accounting policy elections, estimates, and assumptions that affect the reported amount of assets, liabilities, reserves, and expenses. These accounting policy elections, estimates, and assumptions are based on our best estimates and judgments. We evaluate our policy elections, estimates, and assumptions on an ongoing basis using historical experience and other factors, including the current economic environment. We believe these estimates to be reasonable given the current facts available. We adjust our policy elections, estimates, and assumptions when facts and circumstances dictate. Market volatility, including foreign currency exchange rates, increases the uncertainty inherent in our estimates and assumptions. As future events and their effects cannot be determined with precision, actual results could differ significantly from estimates. If actual amounts differ from estimates, we include the revisions in our consolidated results of operations in the period the actual amounts become known. Historically, the aggregate differences, if any, between our estimates and actual amounts in any year have not had a material effect on our consolidated financial statements. \\n\\nReclassifications \\n\\nWe made reclassifications and adjustments to certain previously reported financial information to conform to our current period presentation. \\n\\nHeld for Sale \\n\\nAt December 31, 2022, we classified certain assets as held for sale in our consolidated balance sheet, primarily relating to land use rights across the globe. At December 25, 2021, we classified certain assets as held for sale in our consolidated balance sheet, including inventory in our International segment and certain manufacturing equipment and land use rights across the globe. \\n\\nCash , Cash Equivalents , and Restricted Cash \\n\\nCash equivalents include term deposits with banks, money market funds, and all highly liquid investments with original maturities of three months or less. The fair value of cash equivalents approximates the carrying amount. Cash and cash equivalents that are legally restricted as to withdrawal or usage are classified in other current assets or other non-current assets, as applicable, on the consolidated balance sheets. Restricted cash recorded in other non-current assets was $ 1 million at December 31, 2022 and $ 1 million at December 25, 2021. Total cash, cash equivalents, and restricted cash was $ 1,041 million at December 31, 2022 and $ 3,446 million at December 25, 2021. \\n\\nNote 2. Significant Accounting Policies \\n\\nRevenue Recognition: \\n\\nOur revenues are primarily derived from customer orders for the purchase of our products. We recognize revenues as performance obligations are fulfilled when control passes to our customers. We record revenues net of variable consideration, including consumer incentives and performance obligations related to trade promotions, excluding taxes, and including all shipping and handling charges billed to customers (accounting for shipping and handling charges that occur after the transfer of control as fulfillment costs). We also record a refund liability for estimated product returns and customer allowances as reductions to revenues within the same period that the revenue is recognized. We base these estimates principally on historical and current period experience factors. We recognize costs paid to third party brokers to obtain contracts as expenses as our contracts are generally less than one year. \\n\\nAdvertising, Consumer Incentives, and Trade Promotions: \\n\\nWe promote our products with advertising, consumer incentives, and performance obligations related to trade promotions. Consumer incentives and trade promotions include, but are not limited to, discounts, coupons, rebates, performance-based in-store display activities, and volume-based incentives. Variable consideration related to consumer incentive and trade promotion activities is recorded as a reduction to revenues based on amounts estimated as being due to customers and consumers at the end of a period. We base these estimates principally on historical utilization, redemption rates, and/or current period experience factors. We review and adjust these estimates at least quarterly based on actual experience and other information. \\n\\nAdvertising expenses are recorded in selling, general and administrative expenses (“SG&A”). For interim reporting purposes, we charge advertising to operations as a percentage of estimated full year sales activity and marketing costs. We then review and adjust these estimates each quarter based on actual experience and other information. Our definition of advertising expenses includes advertising production costs, in-store advertising costs, agency fees, brand promotions and events, and sponsorships, in addition to costs to obtain advertising in television, radio, print, digital, and social channels. We recorded advertising expenses of $ 945 million in 2022, $ 1,039 million in 2021, and $ 1,070 million in 2020. We also incur market research costs, which are recorded in SG&A but are excluded from advertising expenses. \\n\\nResearch and Development Expense: \\n\\nWe expense costs as incurred for product research and development within SG&A. Research and development expenses were approximately $ 127 million in 2022, $ 140 million in 2021, and $ 119 million in 2020. \\n\\nStock-Based Compensation: \\n\\nWe recognize compensation costs related to equity awards on a straight-line basis over the vesting period of the award, which is generally three to five years , or on a straight-line basis over the requisite service period for each separately vesting portion of the awards. These costs are primarily recognized within SG&A. We estimate expected forfeitures rather than recognizing forfeitures as they occur in determining our equity award compensation costs. We classify equity award compensation costs primarily within general corporate expenses. See Note 10, Employees’ Stock Incentive Plans , for additional information. \\n\\nPostemployment Benefit Plans: \\n\\nWe maintain various retirement plans for the majority of our employees. These include pension benefits, postretirement health care benefits, and defined contribution benefits. The cost of these plans is charged to expense over an appropriate term based on, among other things, the cost component and whether the plan is active or inactive. Changes in the fair value of our plan assets result in net actuarial gains or losses. These net actuarial gains and losses are deferred into accumulated other comprehensive income/(losses) and amortized within other expense/(income) in future periods using the corridor approach. The corridor is 10% of the greater of the market-related value of the plan’s asset or projected benefit obligation. Any actuarial gains and losses in excess of the corridor are then amortized over an appropriate term based on whether the plan is active or inactive. See Note 11, Postemployment Benefits , for additional information. \\n\\nIncome Taxes: \\n\\nWe recognize income taxes based on amounts refundable or payable for the current year and record deferred tax assets or liabilities for any difference between the financial reporting and tax basis of our assets and liabilities. We also recognize deferred tax assets for temporary differences, operating loss carryforwards, and tax credit carryforwards. Inherent in determining our annual tax rate are judgments regarding business plans, planning opportunities, and expectations about future outcomes. Realization of certain deferred tax assets, primarily net operating loss and other carryforwards, is dependent upon generating sufficient taxable income in the appropriate jurisdiction prior to the expiration of the carryforward periods. \\n\\nWe apply a more-likely-than-not threshold to the recognition and derecognition of uncertain tax positions. Accordingly, we recognize the amount of tax benefit that has a greater than 50 percent likelihood of being ultimately realized upon settlement. Future changes in judgment related to the expected ultimate resolution of uncertain tax positions will affect our results in the quarter of such change. \\n\\nWe record valuation allowances to reduce deferred tax assets to the amount that is more likely than not to be realized. When assessing the need for valuation allowances, we consider future taxable income and ongoing prudent and feasible tax planning strategies. Should a change in circumstances lead to a change in judgment about the realizability of deferred tax assets in future years, we would adjust related valuation allowances in the period that the change in circumstances occurs, along with a corresponding adjustment to our provision for/(benefit from) income taxes. The resolution of tax reserves and changes in valuation allowances could be material to our results of operations for any period, but is not expected to be material to our financial position. \\n\\nCommon Stock and Preferred Stock Dividends: \\n\\nDividends are recorded as a reduction to retained earnings. When we have an accumulated deficit, dividends are recorded as a reduction of additional paid-in capital. \\n\\nInventories: \\n\\nInventories are stated at the lower of cost or net realizable value. We value inventories primarily using the average cost method. \\n\\nProperty, Plant and Equipment: \\n\\nProperty, plant and equipment are stated at historical cost and depreciated on the straight-line method over the estimated useful lives of the assets. Machinery and equipment are depreciated over periods ranging from three years to 20 years and buildings and improvements over periods up to 40 years. Capitalized software costs are included in property, plant and equipment if we have the contractual right to take possession of the software at any time and it is feasible for us to either run the software on our own hardware or contract with a third party to host the software. These costs are amortized on a straight-line basis over the estimated useful lives of the software, which do not exceed seven years . We review long-lived assets for impairment when conditions exist that indicate the carrying amount of the assets may not be fully recoverable. Such conditions could include significant adverse changes in the business climate, current-period operating or cash flow losses, significant declines in forecasted operations, or a current expectation that an asset group will be disposed of before the end of its useful life. We perform undiscounted operating cash flow analyses to determine if an impairment exists. When testing for impairment of assets held for use, we group assets at the lowest level for which cash flows are separately identifiable. If an impairment is determined to exist, the loss is calculated based on estimated fair value. Impairment losses on assets to be disposed of, if any, are based on the estimated proceeds to be received, less costs of disposal. \\n\\nHosted Cloud Computing Arrangement that is a Service Contract: \\n\\nDeferred implementation costs for hosted cloud computing service arrangements are stated at historical cost and amortized on a straight-line basis over the term of the hosting arrangement that the implementation costs relate to. Deferred implementation costs to be amortized during the next 12 months for these arrangements are included in prepaid expenses and amortized to SG&A. All remaining amounts to be amortized are included in other non-current assets. The corresponding cash flows related to these arrangements will be reported within operating activities. We review the deferred implementation costs for impairment when we believe the deferred costs may no longer be recoverable. Such conditions could include situations where the arrangement is not expected to provide substantive service potential, a significant change occurs in the manner in which the arrangement is used or expected to be used, including early cancellation or termination of the arrangement, or situations where the arrangement has had, or will have, a significant change made to it. In instances where we have concluded that an impairment exists, we accelerate the deferred costs on the consolidated balance sheet for immediate expense recognition in SG&A. \\n\\nGoodwill and Intangible Assets : \\n\\nWe maintain 11 reporting units, seven of which comprise our goodwill balance. Our indefinite-lived intangible asset balance primarily consists of a number of individual brands. We test our reporting units and brands for impairment annually as of the first day of our third quarter, or more frequently if events or circumstances indicate it is more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit or brand is less than its carrying amount. Such events and circumstances could include a sustained decrease in our market capitalization, increased competition or unexpected loss of market share, increased input costs beyond projections, disposals of significant brands or components of our business, unexpected business disruptions (for example due to a natural disaster, pandemic, or loss of a customer, supplier, or other significant business relationship), unexpected significant declines in operating results, significant adverse changes in the markets in which we operate, changes in income tax rates, changes in interest rates, or changes in management strategy. We test reporting units for impairment by comparing the estimated fair value of each reporting unit with its carrying amount. We test brands for impairment by comparing the estimated fair value of each brand with its carrying amount. If the carrying amount of a reporting unit or brand exceeds its estimated fair value, we record an impairment loss based on the difference between fair value and carrying amount, in the case of reporting units, not to exceed the associated carrying amount of goodwill. See Note 8, Goodwill and Intangible Assets , in Item 8, Financial Statements and Supplementary Data , for a discussion of the timing of the annual impairment test. \\n\\nDefinite-lived intangible assets are amortized on a straight-line basis over the estimated periods benefited. We review definite-lived intangible assets for impairment when conditions exist that indicate the carrying amount of the assets may not be recoverable. Such conditions could include significant adverse changes in the business climate, current-period operating or cash flow losses, significant declines in forecasted operations, or a current expectation that an asset group will be disposed of before the end of its useful life. We perform undiscounted operating cash flow analyses to determine if an impairment exists. When testing for impairment of definite-lived intangible assets held for use, we group assets at the lowest level for which cash flows are separately identifiable. If an impairment is determined to exist, the loss is calculated based on estimated fair value. Impairment losses on definite-lived intangible assets to be disposed of, if any, are based on the estimated proceeds to be received, less costs of disposal. \\n\\nSee Note 8, Goodwill and Intangible Assets , for additional information. \\n\\nLeases: \\n\\nWe determine whether a contract is or contains a lease at contract inception based on the presence of identified assets and our right to obtain substantially all the economic benefit from and to direct the use of such assets. When we determine a lease exists, we record a right-of-use (“ROU”) asset and corresponding lease liability on our consolidated balance sheet. ROU assets represent our right to use an underlying asset for the lease term. Lease liabilities represent our obligation to make lease payments arising from the lease. ROU assets are recognized at the lease commencement date at the value of the lease liability and are adjusted for any prepayments, lease incentives received, and initial direct costs incurred. Lease liabilities are recognized at the lease commencement date based on the present value of remaining lease payments over the lease term. As the discount rate implicit in the lease is not readily determinable in most of our leases, we use our incremental borrowing rate (dependent on tenor and currency and adjusted to reflect collateralization) based on the information available at the lease commencement date in determining the present value of lease payments. Our lease terms include options to extend or terminate the lease when it is reasonably certain that we will exercise that option. \\n\\nWe do not record lease contracts with a term of 12 months or less on our consolidated balance sheets. \\n\\nWe recognize fixed lease expense for operating leases on a straight-line basis over the lease term. For finance leases, we recognize amortization expense over the shorter of the estimated useful life of the underlying assets or the lease term. In instances of title transfer, expense is recognized over the useful life. Interest expense on a finance lease is recognized using the effective interest method over the lease term. \\n\\nWe have lease agreements with non-lease components that relate to the lease components (e.g., common area maintenance such as cleaning or landscaping, insurance, etc.). We account for each lease and any non-lease components associated with that lease as a single lease component for all underlying asset classes. Accordingly, all costs associated with a lease contract are accounted for as lease costs. \\n\\nCertain leasing arrangements require variable payments that are dependent on usage or output or may vary for other reasons, such as insurance and tax payments. Variable lease payments that do not depend on an index or rate are excluded from lease payments in the measurement of the ROU asset and lease liability and are recognized as expense in the period in which the payment occurs. \\n\\nOur lease agreements do not include significant restrictions or covenants, and residual value guarantees are generally not included within our leases. \\n\\nFinancial Instruments: \\n\\nAs we source our commodities on global markets and periodically enter into financing or other arrangements abroad, we use a variety of risk management strategies and financial instruments to manage commodity price, foreign currency exchange rate, and interest rate risks. Our risk management program focuses on the unpredictability of financial markets and seeks to reduce the potentially adverse effects that the volatility of these markets may have on our operating results. One way we do this is through actively hedging our risks through the use of derivative instruments. As a matter of policy, we do not use highly leveraged derivative instruments, nor do we use financial instruments for speculative purposes. \\n\\nDerivatives are recorded on our consolidated balance sheets as assets or liabilities at fair value, which fluctuates based on changing market conditions. \\n\\nCertain derivatives are designated as cash flow hedges and qualify for hedge accounting treatment, while others are not designated as hedging instruments and are marked to market through net income/(loss). The gains and losses on cash flow hedges are deferred as a component of accumulated other comprehensive income/(losses) and are recognized in net income/(loss) at the time the hedged item affects net income/(loss), in the same line item as the underlying hedged item. The excluded component on cash flow hedges is recognized in net income/(loss) over the life of the hedging relationship in the same income statement line item as the underlying hedged item. We also designate certain derivatives and non-derivatives as net investment hedges to hedge the net assets of certain foreign subsidiaries which are exposed to volatility in foreign currency exchange rates. Changes in the value of these derivatives and remeasurements of our non-derivatives designated as net investment hedges are calculated each period using the spot method, with changes reported in foreign currency translation adjustment within accumulated other comprehensive income/(losses). Such amounts will remain in accumulated other comprehensive income/(losses) until the complete or substantially complete liquidation of our investment in the underlying foreign operations. The excluded component on derivatives designated as net investment hedges is recognized in net income/(loss) within interest expense. The income statement classification of gains and losses related to derivative instruments not designated as hedging instruments is determined based on the underlying intent of the contracts. Cash flows related to the settlement of derivative instruments designated as net investment hedges of foreign operations are classified in the consolidated statements of cash flows within investing activities. All other cash flows related to derivative instruments are classified in the same line item as the cash flows of the related hedged item, which is generally within operating activities. \\n\\nTo qualify for hedge accounting, a specified level of hedging effectiveness between the hedging instrument and the item being hedged must be achieved at inception and maintained throughout the hedged period. When a hedging instrument no longer meets the specified level of hedging effectiveness, we reclassify the related hedge gains or losses previously deferred into other comprehensive income/(losses) to net income/(loss) within other expense/(income). We formally document our risk management objectives, our strategies for undertaking the various hedge transactions, the nature of and relationships between the hedging instruments and hedged items, and the method for assessing hedge effectiveness. Additionally, for qualified hedges of forecasted transactions, we specifically identify the significant characteristics and expected terms of the forecasted transactions. If it becomes probable that a forecasted transaction will not occur, the hedge will no longer be effective and all of the derivative gains or losses would be recognized in net income/(loss) in the current period. \\n\\nUnrealized gains and losses on our commodity derivatives not designated as hedging instruments are recorded in cost of products sold and are included within general corporate expenses until realized. Once realized, the gains and losses are included within the applicable segment operating results. See Note 12, Financial Instruments , for additional information. \\n\\nOur designated and undesignated derivative contracts include: \\n\\n• Net investment hedges. We have numerous investments in our foreign subsidiaries, the net assets of which are exposed to volatility in foreign currency exchange rates. We manage this risk by utilizing derivative and non-derivative instruments, including cross-currency swap contracts, foreign exchange contracts, and certain foreign denominated debt designated as net investment hedges. We exclude the interest accruals and any off-market values on cross-currency swap contracts and the forward points on foreign exchange forward contracts from the assessment and measurement of hedge effectiveness. We recognize the interest accruals and any amortization of off-market values on cross-currency swap contracts in net income/(loss) within interest expense. We amortize the forward points on foreign exchange contracts into net income/(loss) within interest expense over the life of the hedging relationship. \\n\\n• Foreign currency cash flow hedges. We use various financial instruments to mitigate our exposure to changes in exchange rates from third-party and intercompany actual and forecasted transactions. Our principal foreign currency exposures that are hedged include the euro, British pound sterling, and Canadian dollar. These instruments include cross-currency swap contracts and foreign exchange forward and option contracts. Substantially all of these derivative instruments are highly effective and qualify for hedge accounting treatment. We exclude the interest accruals on cross-currency swap contracts (when interest is not a hedged item) and the forward points and option premiums or discounts on foreign exchange contracts from the assessment and measurement of hedge effectiveness and amortize such amounts into net income/(loss) in the same line item as the underlying hedged item over the life of the hedging relationship. \\n\\n• Interest rate cash flow hedges. From time to time, we have used derivative instruments, including interest rate swaps, as part of our interest rate risk management strategy. We have primarily used interest rate swaps to hedge the variability of interest payment cash flows on a portion of our future debt obligations. \\n\\n• Commodity derivatives. We are exposed to price risk related to forecasted purchases of certain commodities that we primarily use as raw materials. We enter into commodity purchase contracts primarily for dairy products, vegetable oils, coffee beans, wheat products, corn products, sugar, meat products, and cocoa products. These commodity purchase contracts generally are not subject to the accounting requirements for derivative instruments and hedging activities under the normal purchases and normal sales exception. We also use commodity futures, options, and swaps to economically hedge the price of certain commodity costs, including the commodities noted above, as well as diesel fuel, packaging products, and natural gas. We do not designate these commodity contracts as hedging instruments. We also occasionally use futures to economically cross hedge a commodity exposure. \\n\\nTranslation of Foreign Currencies: \\n\\nFor all significant foreign operations, the functional currency is the local currency. Assets and liabilities of these operations are translated at the exchange rate in effect at each period end. Income statement accounts are translated at the average rate of exchange prevailing during the period. Foreign currency translation adjustments arising from the use of differing exchange rates from period to period are included as a component of accumulated other comprehensive income/(losses) on our consolidated balance sheet. Gains and losses from foreign currency transactions are included in net income/(loss) for the period. \\n\\nHighly Inflationary Accounting: \\n\\nWe apply highly inflationary accounting if the cumulative inflation rate in an economy for a three-year period meets or exceeds 100%. Under highly inflationary accounting, the financial statements of a subsidiary are remeasured into our reporting currency (U.S. dollars) based on the legally available exchange rate at which we expect to settle the underlying transactions. Exchange gains and losses from the remeasurement of monetary assets and liabilities are reflected in other expense/(income) on our consolidated statement of income, rather than accumulated other comprehensive income/(losses) on our consolidated balance sheet, until such time as the economy is no longer considered highly inflationary. Certain non-monetary assets and liabilities are recorded at the applicable historical exchange rates. We applied highly inflationary accounting to the results of our subsidiaries in Turkey, Venezuela, and Argentina which resulted in insignificant nonmonetary currency devaluation losses in other expense/(income) in the periods presented. The net monetary assets of each of our subsidiaries in Turkey, Venezuela, and Argentina were insignificant at December 31, 2022. Our results of operations in Turkey, Venezuela, and Argentina reflect those of controlled subsidiaries. \\n\\nNote 3. New Accounting Standards \\n\\nAccounting Standards Not Yet Adopted \\n\\nAccounting for Contract Assets and Contract Liabilities from Contracts with Customers: ', 'In October 2021, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (the “FASB”) issued Accounting Standards Update (“ASU”) 2021-08 to amend the accounting for contract assets and contract liabilities acquired in a business combination under Accounting Standards Codification (“ASC”) 805, Business Combinations . The guidance requires entities engaged in a business combination to recognize and measure contract assets acquired and contract liabilities assumed in accordance with ASC 606, Revenue from Contracts with Customers , rather than at fair value on the acquisition date. The amendments also apply to other contracts such as contract liabilities arising from nonfinancial assets under ASC 610-20, Other Income – Gains and Losses from the Derecognition of Nonfinancial Assets . The ASU will be effective beginning in the first quarter of 2023. Early adoption is permitted, including in an interim period. We currently expect to adopt ASU 2021-08 in the first quarter of 2023 on a prospective basis. While the impact of these amendments is dependent on the nature of any future transactions, we currently do not expect this ASU to have a significant impact on our financial statements and related disclosures. ', 'Supplier Finance Programs (Topic 405-50) - Disclosure of Supplier Finance Program Obligations: \\n\\nIn September 2022, the FASB issued ASU 2022-04 to add disclosure requirements relative to supplier financing programs under ASC 405, Liabilities . The guidance requires entities that maintain supplier financing programs to provide information in their financial statements about their use of supplier finance programs and their effect on the entity’s working capital, liquidity, and cash flows. Specifically, the amendment requires entities to disclose the key terms of their programs, amounts outstanding, balance sheet presentation, and a rollforward of amounts outstanding during the annual period. Only the amount outstanding at the end of the period is required to be disclosed in interim periods. The ASU will be effective beginning in the first quarter of 2023, except for the rollforward requirement, which is effective in fiscal year 2024. Early adoption is permitted. While we currently disclose the amounts outstanding on our existing trade payables programs, we are reviewing the provisions of this new pronouncement but do not expect this ASU to have a significant impact on our financial statements and related disclosures. \\n\\nNote 4. Acquisitions and Divestitures \\n\\nAcquisitions \\n\\nHemmer Acquisition: \\n\\nOn March 31, 2022 (the “Hemmer Acquisition Date”), we acquired a majority of the outstanding equity interests of Companhia Hemmer Indústria e Comércio (“Hemmer”), a Brazilian food and beverage manufacturing company focused on the condiments and sauces category, from certain third-party shareholders (the “Hemmer Acquisition”). ', 'The Hemmer Acquisition was accounted for under the acquisition method of accounting for business combinations. Total cash consideration related to the Hemmer Acquisition was approximately 1.3 billion Brazilian reais (approximately $ 279 million at the Hemmer Acquisition Date). A noncontrolling interest was recognized at fair value, which was determined to be the noncontrolling interest’s proportionate share of the acquiree’s identifiable net assets, as of the Hemmer Acquisition Date. As of the Hemmer Acquisition Date, we acquired 94 % of the outstanding shares of Hemmer. In the third quarter of 2022, we completed the redemption of the remaining outstanding shares and own 100 % of the controlling interest in Hemmer. ', 'We entered into foreign exchange derivative contracts to economically hedge the foreign currency exposure related to the cash consideration for the Hemmer Acquisition. See Note 12, Financial Instruments , for additional information. \\n\\nWe utilized fair values at the Hemmer Acquisition Date to allocate the total consideration exchanged to the net tangible and intangible assets acquired and liabilities assumed. \\n\\nThe fair value estimates of the assets acquired are subject to adjustment during the measurement period (up to one year from the Hemmer Acquisition Date). The primary areas of accounting for the Hemmer Acquisition that are not yet finalized relate to the fair value of certain tangible net assets acquired, residual goodwill, and any related tax impact. The fair values of these net assets acquired are based on management’s estimates and assumptions, as well as other information compiled by management, including valuations that utilize customary valuation procedures and techniques. While we believe that such preliminary estimates provide a reasonable basis for estimating the fair value of assets acquired and liabilities assumed, we will evaluate any additional information prior to finalization of the fair value. During the measurement period, we will adjust preliminary valuations assigned to assets and liabilities if new information is obtained about facts and circumstances that existed as of the Hemmer Acquisition Date, that, if known, would have resulted in revised values for these items as of that date. The impact of all changes, if any, that do not qualify as measurement period adjustments will be included in current period earnings. \\n\\nThe preliminary purchase price allocation to assets acquired and liabilities assumed in the Hemmer Acquisition was (in millions): \\n\\n Initial Allocation (a) ', 'Adjustments Updated Allocation Cash $ 1 \\xa0 $ — \\xa0 $ 1 \\xa0 Trade receivables 13 \\xa0 — \\xa0 13 \\xa0 Inventories 17 \\xa0 — \\xa0 17 \\xa0 Other current assets 2 \\xa0 — \\xa0 2 \\xa0 Property, plant and equipment, net 14 \\xa0 — \\xa0 14 \\xa0 Identifiable intangible assets 122 \\xa0 — \\xa0 122 \\xa0 Other non-current assets 13 \\xa0 4 \\xa0 17 \\xa0 Short-term debt ( 9 ) — \\xa0 ( 9 ) Trade payables ( 11 ) — \\xa0 ( 11 ) Other current liabilities ( 31 ) — \\xa0 ( 31 ) Long-term debt ( 11 ) — \\xa0 ( 11 ) Other non-current liabilities ( 44 ) — \\xa0 ( 44 ) Net assets acquired 76 \\xa0 4 \\xa0 80 \\xa0 Noncontrolling interest ( 16 ) — \\xa0 ( 16 ) Goodwill on acquisition 219 \\xa0 ( 4 ) 215 \\xa0 Total consideration $ 279 \\xa0 $ — \\xa0 $ 279 \\xa0 ', '(a) As reported in Note 4, Acquisitions and Divestitures , to our condensed consolidated financial statements in our Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q for the three months ended June 25, 2022. \\n\\nThe Hemmer Acquisition preliminarily resulted in $ 219 million of non-tax deductible goodwill relating principally to Hemmer’s long-term experience and large presence operating in emerging markets. In the fourth quarter of 2022, a portion of the goodwill became tax deductible following the merger of Hemmer into our existing legal entity structure. This goodwill was assigned to the Latin America (“LATAM”) reporting unit within our International segment. In the fourth quarter of 2022, certain insignificant measurement period adjustments were made to the initial allocation, and the preliminary amount of goodwill was adjusted to $ 215 million. See Note 8, Goodwill and Intangible Assets , for additional information. \\n\\nThe preliminary purchase price allocation to identifiable intangible assets acquired in the Hemmer Acquisition was: \\n\\n Fair Value (in millions of dollars) Weighted Average Life (in years) Definite-lived trademarks $ 101 \\xa0 13 Customer-related assets 21 \\xa0 15 Total $ 122 \\xa0 \\n\\nWe valued trademarks using the relief from royalty method and customer-related assets using the distributor method. Some of the more significant assumptions inherent in developing the valuations included the estimated annual net cash flows for each definite-lived intangible asset (including net sales, cost of products sold, selling and marketing costs, and working capital/contributory asset charges), the discount rate that appropriately reflects the risk inherent in each future cash flow stream, the assessment of each asset’s life cycle, and competitive trends, as well as other factors. We determined the assumptions used in the financial forecasts using historical data, supplemented by current and anticipated market conditions, estimated product category growth rates, management’s plans, and market comparables. \\n\\nWe used carrying values as of the Hemmer Acquisition Date to value certain current and non-current assets and liabilities, as we determined that they represented the fair value of those items at such date. \\n\\nJust Spices Acquisition: \\n\\nOn January 18, 2022 (the “Just Spices Acquisition Date”), we acquired 85 % of the shares of Just Spices GmbH (“Just Spices”), a German-based company focused on direct-to-consumer sales of premium spice blends, from certain third-party shareholders (the “Just Spices Acquisition”). ', 'The Just Spices Acquisition was accounted for under the acquisition method of accounting for business combinations. Total cash consideration related to the Just Spices Acquisition was approximately 214 million euros (approximately $ 243 million at the Just Spices Acquisition Date). A noncontrolling interest was recognized at fair value, which was determined to be the noncontrolling interest’s proportionate share of the acquiree’s identifiable net assets, as of the Just Spices Acquisition Date. Under the terms of certain transaction agreements, Just Spices’ other equity holders each have a put option to require us to purchase the remaining equity interests beginning three years after the Just Spices Acquisition Date. If the put option is not exercised, we have a call option to acquire the remaining equity interests of Just Spices. Considering the contractual terms related to the noncontrolling interest, it is classified as redeemable noncontrolling interest on our consolidated balance sheet. ', 'Subsequent to the Just Spices Acquisition, the redeemable noncontrolling interest is measured at the greater of the amount that would be paid if settlement occurred as of the balance sheet date based on the contractually defined redemption value and its carrying amount adjusted for the net income/(loss) attributable to the noncontrolling interest. \\n\\nWe utilized fair values at the Just Spices Acquisition Date to allocate the total consideration exchanged to the net tangible and intangible assets acquired and liabilities assumed. The purchase price allocation for the Just Spices Acquisition was final as of December 31, 2022. \\n\\nThe final purchase price allocation to assets acquired and liabilities assumed in the Just Spices Acquisition was (in millions): \\n\\n Initial Allocation (a) ', 'Adjustments Final Allocation Cash $ 2 \\xa0 $ — \\xa0 $ 2 \\xa0 Trade receivables 4 \\xa0 — \\xa0 4 \\xa0 Inventories 7 \\xa0 — \\xa0 7 \\xa0 Other current assets 9 \\xa0 — \\xa0 9 \\xa0 Property, plant and equipment, net 1 \\xa0 — \\xa0 1 \\xa0 Identifiable intangible assets 172 \\xa0 — \\xa0 172 \\xa0 Other non-current assets — \\xa0 7 \\xa0 7 \\xa0 Trade payables ( 10 ) — \\xa0 ( 10 ) Other current liabilities ( 12 ) — \\xa0 ( 12 ) Other non-current liabilities ( 54 ) — \\xa0 ( 54 ) Net assets acquired 119 \\xa0 7 \\xa0 126 \\xa0 Redeemable noncontrolling interest ( 43 ) 4 \\xa0 ( 39 ) Goodwill on acquisition 167 \\xa0 ( 11 ) 156 \\xa0 Total consideration $ 243 \\xa0 $ — \\xa0 $ 243 \\xa0 ', '(a) As reported in Note 4, Acquisitions and Divestitures , to our condensed consolidated financial statements in our Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q for the three months ended March 26, 2022. \\n\\nThe Just Spices Acquisition preliminarily resulted in $ 167 million of non-tax deductible goodwill relating principally to Just Spices’ social media presence. This goodwill was assigned to the Continental Europe reporting unit within our International segment. In the second quarter of 2022, certain insignificant measurement period adjustments were made to the initial allocation, and the preliminary amount of goodwill was adjusted to $ 163 million. We did not record any measurement period adjustments in the third quarter of 2022. In the fourth quarter of 2022, additional insignificant measurement period adjustments were made to the initial allocation, and the final amount of goodwill was adjusted to $ 156 million. In the fourth quarter of 2022, we finalized the purchase accounting for the Just Spices Acquisition.

', 'The Assan Foods Acquisition was accounted for under the acquisition method of accounting for business combinations. Total consideration related to the Assan Foods Acquisition was approximately $ 79 million, including cash consideration of $ 70 million and contingent consideration of approximately $ 9 million. We utilized fair values at the Assan Foods Acquisition Date to allocate the total consideration exchanged to the net tangible and intangible assets acquired and liabilities assumed.

This goodwill was assigned to the EMEA East reporting unit within our International segment. Following the measurement period adjustments made in the first quarter of 2022, the preliminary amount of goodwill was adjusted to $ 51 million as of March 26, 2022. In the second and third quarters of 2022, we did not record any measurement period adjustments. In the third quarter of 2022, we finalized the purchase accounting for the Assan Foods Acquisition.

The loss on extinguishment related to the repayment of this debt was insignificant. Cash payments related to debt extinguishment are classified as cash outflows from financing activities on the consolidated statements of cash flows. \\n\\nOther Acquisitions: \\n\\nIn the fourth quarter of 2021, we acquired a majority stake in BR Spices Indústria e Comércio de Alimentos Ltda. (“BR Spices”), a manufacturer of spices and other seasonings in Brazil, for an insignificant amount of cash consideration (the “BR Spices Acquisition”). The noncontrolling interest associated with BR Spices is included in redeemable noncontrolling interest on our consolidated balance sheet at December 31, 2022 and December 25, 2021. \\n\\nDeal Costs: ', 'Related to our acquisitions, we incurred insignificant deal costs in 2022 and 2021. We recognized these deal costs in SG&A. There were no deal costs related to acquisitions in 2020. ', 'Divestitures \\n\\nPowdered Cheese Transaction: \\n\\nIn August 2022, we entered into a definitive agreement with a third party, Kerry Group, to sell our business-to-business powdered cheese business (the “Powdered Cheese Transaction”). The net assets transferred in the Powdered Cheese Transaction include, among other things, the Albany, Minnesota manufacturing facility (collectively, the “Powdered Cheese Disposal Group”). \\n\\nThe Powdered Cheese Transaction closed in the fourth quarter of 2022 for total consideration of approximately $ 108 million. As a result of the Powered Cheese Transaction closing, we recognized a pre-tax gain on sale of business of approximately $ 26 million. \\n\\nCheese Transaction: \\n\\nIn September 2020, we entered into a definitive agreement with a third party, an affiliate of Groupe Lactalis (“Lactalis”), to sell certain assets in our global cheese business, as well as to license certain trademarks, for total consideration of approximately $ 3.3 billion, including approximately $ 3.2 billion of cash consideration and approximately $ 141 million related to a perpetual license for the Cracker Barrel brand that Lactalis granted to us for certain products (the “Cheese Transaction”). The Cheese Transaction had two primary components. The first component related to the perpetual licenses for the Kraft and Velveeta brands that we granted to Lactalis for certain cheese products (the “ Kraft and Velveeta Licenses”), along with a three-year transitional license that we granted to Lactalis for the Philadelphia brand (the “ Philadelphia License” and collectively, the “Cheese Divestiture Licenses”). The second component related to the net assets transferred to Lactalis (the “Cheese Disposal Group”). The Cheese Transaction closed on November 29, 2021 (the “Cheese Transaction Closing Date”). \\n\\nOf the $ 3.3 billion total consideration, approximately $ 1.6 billion was attributed to the Cheese Divestiture Licenses based on the estimated fair value of the licensed portion of each brand. As of the Cheese Transaction Closing Date, the license income related to the Kraft and Velveeta Licenses will be recognized over approximately 30 years and the license income related to the Philadelphia License will be recognized over approximately three years . Related to the Cheese Divestiture Licenses, we recognized approximately $ 56 million of license income in 2022 and an insignificant amount of license income in 2021, which was recorded as a reduction to SG&A and classified as divestiture-related license income. Additionally, at December 31, 2022, we have recorded approximately $ 1.5 billion in long-term deferred income and $ 56 million in other current liabilities on the consolidated balance sheet related to the Cheese Divestiture Licenses. \\n\\nIn the first quarter of 2022, we reimbursed Lactalis approximately $ 20 million following a final inventory count performed after the Cheese Transaction closed. This amount reflects the difference between the estimated and actual value of inventory transferred, which was primarily driven by seasonal fluctuations in finished goods. The payment to Lactalis was recognized in our consolidated statement of cash flows for the year ended December 31, 2022 as a cash outflow from investing activities in proceeds from sale of business, net of cash disposed and working capital adjustments. \\n\\nIn the second quarter of 2021, we assessed the fair value less costs to sell of the net assets of the Cheese Disposal Group and recorded an estimated pre-tax loss on sale of business of approximately $ 27 million, which was recognized in other expense/(income). \\n\\nFollowing the closing of the Cheese Transaction in the fourth quarter of 2021, we recognized an incremental pre-tax gain on sale of business of $ 27 million in other expense/(income). In 2021, the total gain/loss on sale of business related to the Cheese Transaction was insignificant. Additional considerations related to the Cheese Transaction included the treatment of the Cheese Divestiture Licenses upon closing of the transaction. In the fourth quarter of 2021, at the time the licensed rights were granted, we reassessed the remaining fair value of the retained portions of the Kraft and Velveeta brands and recorded a non-cash intangible asset impairment loss related to the Kraft brand of approximately $ 1.24 billion, which was recognized in SG&A. \\n\\nSee Note 4, Acquisitions and Divestitures , to the consolidated financial statements in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 25, 2021 for additional information related to the Cheese Transaction. \\n\\nNuts Transaction: \\n\\nIn February 2021, we entered into a definitive agreement with a third party, Hormel Foods Corporation, to sell certain assets in our global nuts business for total consideration of approximately $ 3.4 billion (the “Nuts Transaction”). The net assets transferred in the Nuts Transaction included, among other things, our intellectual property rights to the Planters brand and to the Corn Nuts brand, three manufacturing facilities in the United States, and the associated inventories (collectively, the “Nuts Disposal Group”). \\n\\nAs of February 10, 2021, the date the Nuts Disposal Group was determined to be held for sale, we tested the individual assets included within the Nuts Disposal Group for impairment. The net assets of the Nuts Disposal Group had an aggregate carrying amount above their $ 3.4 billion estimated fair value. We determined that the goodwill within the Nuts Disposal Group was partially impaired. As a result, we recorded a non-cash goodwill impairment loss of $ 230 million, which was recognized in SG&A, in the first quarter of 2021. Additionally, we recorded an estimated pre-tax loss on sale of business of $ 19 million in the first quarter of 2021 primarily related to estimated costs to sell, which was recognized in other expense/(income). \\n\\nThe Nuts Transaction closed in the second quarter of 2021. As a result of the Nuts Transaction closing, we recognized an incremental pre-tax loss on sale of business of $ 17 million in other expense/(income) on our consolidated statement of income in the second quarter of 2021. In the third and fourth quarters of 2021, we recorded insignificant adjustments to our estimated costs to sell, which resulted in an insignificant pre-tax gain on sale of business that was recognized in other expense/(income). In 2021, the total pre-tax loss on sale of business for the Nuts Transaction was $ 34 million, all of which was recognized in other expense/(income) on our consolidated statement of income. \\n\\nSee Note 4, Acquisitions and Divestitures , to the consolidated financial statements in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 25, 2021 for additional information related to the Nuts Transaction. \\n\\nDeal Costs: \\n\\nRelated to our divestitures, we incurred insignificant deal costs in 2022, 2021, and 2020. We recognized these deal costs in SG&A. \\n\\nNote 5. Restructuring Activities \\n\\nAs part of our restructuring activities, we incur expenses that qualify as exit and disposal costs under U.S. GAAP. These include severance and employee benefit costs and other exit costs. Severance and employee benefit costs primarily relate to cash severance, non-cash severance, and pension and other termination benefits. Other exit costs primarily relate to lease and contract terminations. We also incur expenses that are an integral component of, and directly attributable to, our restructuring activities, which do not qualify as exit and disposal costs under U.S. GAAP. These include asset-related costs and other implementation costs. Asset-related costs primarily relate to accelerated depreciation and asset impairment charges. Other implementation costs primarily relate to start-up costs of new facilities, professional fees, asset relocation costs, costs to exit facilities, and costs associated with restructuring benefit plans. \\n\\nEmployee severance and other termination benefit packages are primarily determined based on established benefit arrangements, local statutory requirements, and historical benefit practices. We recognize the contractual component of these benefits when payment is probable and estimable; additional elements of severance and termination benefits associated with non-recurring benefits are recognized ratably over each employee’s required future service period. Charges for accelerated depreciation are recognized on long-lived assets that will be taken out of service before the end of their normal service, in which case depreciation estimates are revised to reflect the use of the asset over its shortened useful life. Asset impairments establish a new fair value basis for assets held for disposal or sale, and those assets are written down to expected net realizable value if carrying value exceeds fair value. All other costs are recognized as incurred. \\n\\nRestructuring Activities: \\n\\nWe have restructuring programs globally, which are focused primarily on reducing our overall cost structure and streamlining our organizational design. In 2022, we eliminated approximately 575 positions related to these programs. As of December 31, 2022, we expect to eliminate approximately 560 additional positions in 2023, primarily outside of the United States and Canada. In 2022, restructuring activities resulted in expenses of $ 74 million and included $ 34 million of severance and employee benefit costs, $ 12 million of asset-related costs, and $ 28 million of other implementation costs. Restructuring activities resulted in expenses of $ 84 million in 2021 and income of $ 2 million in 2020. \\n\\nOur net liability balance for restructuring project costs that qualify as exit and disposal costs under U.S. GAAP was (in millions): \\n\\n Severance and Employee Benefit Costs Other Exit Costs Total Balance at December 25, 2021 $ 27 \\xa0 $ 16 \\xa0 $ 43 \\xa0 Charges/(credits) 34 \\xa0 — \\xa0 34 \\xa0 Cash payments ( 33 ) ( 5 ) ( 38 ) Balance at December 31, 2022 $ 28 \\xa0 $ 11 \\xa0 $ 39 \\xa0 \\n\\nWe expect the liability for severance and employee benefit costs as of December 31, 2022 to be paid by the end of 2023. The liability for other exit costs primarily relates to lease obligations. The cash impact of these obligations will continue for the duration of the lease terms, which expire between 2023 and 2026. \\n\\nTotal Expenses/(Income): \\n\\nTotal expense/(income) related to restructuring activities by income statement caption, were (in millions): \\n\\n December 31, 2022 December 25, 2021 December 26, 2020 Severance and employee benefit costs - Cost of products sold $ 1 \\xa0 $ 12 \\xa0 $ — \\xa0 Severance and employee benefit costs - SG&A 33 \\xa0 21 \\xa0 1 \\xa0 Severance and employee benefit costs - Other expense/(income) — \\xa0 1 \\xa0 — \\xa0 Asset-related costs - Cost of products sold 12 \\xa0 — \\xa0 13 \\xa0 Other costs - Cost of products sold 14 \\xa0 1 \\xa0 ( 33 ) Other costs - SG&A 14 \\xa0 49 \\xa0 34 \\xa0 Other costs - Other expense/(income) — \\xa0 — \\xa0 ( 17 ) $ 74 \\xa0 $ 84 \\xa0 $ ( 2 ) \\n\\nWe do not include our restructuring activities within Segment Adjusted EBITDA (as defined in Note 20, Segment Reporting ).

Depreciation expense was $ 672 million in 2022, $ 671 million in 2021, and $ 705 million in 2020. \\n\\nNote 8. Goodwill and Intangible Assets \\n\\nHistorically, we have tested our reporting units and brands for impairment annually as of the first day of our second quarter, or more frequently if events or circumstances indicate it is more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit or brand is less than its carrying amount. As discussed in further detail below, we performed an annual test as of March 27, 2022, the first day of our second quarter (the “Q2 2022 Annual Impairment Test”). Beginning in the third quarter of 2022 and for subsequent annual periods, we voluntarily changed the annual impairment assessment date to the first day of our third quarter and performed an additional annual impairment test as of June 26, 2022 (the “Q3 2022 Annual Impairment Test”). We believe this measurement date, which represents a change in the method of applying an accounting principle, better aligns with the timing of our strategic business planning process and financial forecasts, which are key components of the annual impairment tests and are typically completed in the third quarter of our fiscal year. \\n\\nGoodwill: \\n\\nChanges in the carrying amount of goodwill, by segment, were (in millions): \\n\\n North America International Total Balance at December 26, 2020 $ 29,929 \\xa0 $ 3,160 \\xa0 $ 33,089 \\xa0 Impairment losses ( 35 ) ( 53 ) ( 88 ) Acquisitions — \\xa0 74 \\xa0 74 \\xa0 Divestitures ( 1,662 ) — \\xa0 ( 1,662 ) Translation adjustments and other 10 \\xa0 ( 127 ) ( 117 ) Balance at December 25, 2021 $ 28,242 \\xa0 $ 3,054 \\xa0 $ 31,296 \\xa0 Impairment losses ( 455 ) — \\xa0 ( 455 ) Acquisitions — \\xa0 386 \\xa0 386 \\xa0 Measurement period adjustments — \\xa0 ( 18 ) ( 18 ) Divestitures ( 37 ) — \\xa0 ( 37 ) Translation adjustments and other ( 65 ) ( 274 ) ( 339 ) Balance at December 31, 2022 $ 27,685 \\xa0 $ 3,148 \\xa0 $ 30,833 \\xa0 ']\n"

FINANCIAL STATEMENTS AND SUPPLEMENTARY DATA We identified the evaluation of certain of the Company’s unrecognized tax benefits as a critical audit matter. Specifically, complex auditor judgment, including the involvement of tax and valuation professionals with specialized skills and knowledge, was required in evaluating the Company’s interpretation of tax law and its estimate of the ultimate resolution of its tax positions. The following are the primary procedures we performed to address this critical audit matter. We evaluated the design and tested the operating effectiveness of certain internal controls related to the Company’s process to evaluate uncertain tax positions. This included controls related to the interpretation of tax law, its application in the liability estimation process, and the review of activity that could result in changes to the Company’s unrecognized tax benefits. We involved tax professionals with specialized skills and knowledge, who assisted in evaluating the Company’s interpretation of tax law and tax authority rulings and in performing an independent assessment of certain of the Company’s tax positions and the amount of unrecognized tax benefit, if any, and comparing the results to the Company’s assessment. We also involved valuation professionals with specialized skills and knowledge, who assisted in assessing certain transfer pricing studies for compliance with applicable laws and regulations. /s/ KPMG LLP We have served as the Company’s auditor since 2002.

AND SUBSIDIARIES NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS FEBRUARY 28, 2023 1. DESCRIPTION OF BUSINESS, BASIS OF PRESENTATION, AND SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES Description of business We operate primarily in the beverage alcohol industry with operations in the U.S., Mexico, New Zealand, and Italy producing a powerful portfolio of consumer-connected, high-end imported beer brands, and higher-end wine and spirits brands. Basis of presentation Principles of consolidation Our consolidated financial statements include our accounts and our majority-owned and controlled domestic and foreign subsidiaries. In addition, we have an equally-owned joint venture with Owens-Illinois. The joint venture owns and operates a state-of-the-art glass production plant which provides bottles exclusively for the Nava Brewery. We have determined that we are the primary beneficiary of this variable interest entity and accordingly, the results of operations of the joint venture are reported in the Beer segment and are included in our consolidated results of operations. All intercompany accounts and transactions are eliminated in consolidation. Equity method investments ', 'If we are not required to consolidate our investment in another entity, we use the equity method when we (i) can exercise significant influence over the other entity and (ii) hold common stock and/or in-substance common stock of the other entity. Under the equity method, investments are carried at cost, plus or minus our equity in the increases and decreases in the investee’s net assets after the date of acquisition. We monitor our equity method investments for factors indicating other-than-temporary impairment. Dividends received from the investee reduce the carrying amount of the investment. ', 'Management’s use of estimates The preparation of financial statements in conformity with U.S. GAAP requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period. Actual results could differ from those estimates. Summary of significant accounting policies Revenue recognition Our revenue (referred to in our financial statements as “sales”) consists primarily of the sale of beer, wine, and spirits domestically in the U.S. Sales of products are for cash or otherwise agreed-upon credit terms. Our payment terms vary by location and customer, however, the time period between when revenue is recognized and when payment is due is not significant. Our customers consist primarily of wholesale distributors. Our revenue generating activities have a single performance obligation and are recognized at the point in time when control transfers and our obligation has been fulfilled, which is when the related goods are shipped or delivered to the customer, depending upon the method of distribution, and shipping terms. We have elected to treat shipping as a fulfillment activity. Revenue is measured as the amount of consideration we expect to receive in exchange for the sale of our product. Our sales terms do not allow for a right of return except for matters related to any manufacturing defects on our part. Amounts billed to customers for shipping and handling are included in sales. As noted, the majority of our revenues are generated from the domestic sale of beer, wine, and spirits to wholesale distributors in the U.S. Our other revenue generating activities include the export of certain of our products to select international markets, as well as the sale of our products through state alcohol beverage control agencies, on-premise, retail locations in certain markets, and 3-tier eCommerce and DTC channels. We have evaluated these other revenue generating activities under the disaggregation disclosure criteria and concluded that they are immaterial for separate disclosure. See Note 22 for disclosure of net sales by product type.  Constellation Brands, Inc. FY 2023 Form 10-K #WORTHREACHINGFOR I 70  PART II ITEM 8. FINANCIAL STATEMENTS AND SUPPLEMENTARY DATA Sales reflect reductions attributable to consideration given to customers in various customer incentive programs, including pricing discounts on single transactions, volume discounts, promotional and advertising allowances, coupons, and rebates. This variable consideration is recognized as a reduction of the transaction price based upon expected amounts at the time revenue for the corresponding product sale is recognized. For example, customer promotional discount programs are entered into with certain distributors for certain periods of time. The amount ultimately reimbursed to distributors is determined based upon agreed-upon promotional discounts which are applied to distributors’ sales to retailers. Other common forms of variable consideration include volume rebates for meeting established sales targets, and coupons and mail-in rebates offered to the end consumer. The determination of the reduction of the transaction price for variable consideration requires that we make certain estimates and assumptions that affect the timing and amounts of revenue and liabilities recognized. We estimate this variable consideration by taking into account factors such as the nature of the promotional activity, historical information, and current trends, availability of actual results and expectations of customer and consumer behavior. Excise taxes remitted to tax authorities are government-imposed excise taxes primarily on our beverage alcohol products. Excise taxes are shown on a separate line item as a reduction of sales and are recognized in our results of operations when the related product sale is recognized. Excise taxes are recognized as a current liability in other accrued expenses and liabilities, with the liability subsequently reduced when the taxes are remitted to the tax authority. Cost of product sold The types of costs included in cost of product sold are raw materials, packaging materials, manufacturing costs, plant administrative support and overheads, and freight and warehouse costs (including distribution network costs). Distribution network costs include inbound freight charges and outbound shipping and handling costs, purchasing and receiving costs, inspection costs, and warehousing and internal transfer costs. Selling, general, and administrative expenses The types of costs included in selling, general, and administrative expenses consist predominately of advertising and non-manufacturing administrative and overhead costs. Distribution network costs are included in cost of product sold. We expense advertising costs as incurred, shown, or distributed. Advertising expense for the years ended February 28, 2023, February 28, 2022, and February 28, 2021, was $ 860.8 million, $ 826.4 million, and $ 805.0 million, respectively. Foreign currency translation The functional currency of our foreign subsidiaries is generally the respective local currency. The translation from the applicable foreign currencies to U.S. dollars is performed for balance sheet accounts using exchange rates in effect at the balance sheet date and for revenue and expense accounts using a weighted average exchange rate for the period. The resulting translation adjustments are recognized as a component of AOCI. Gains or losses resulting from foreign currency denominated transactions are included in selling, general, and administrative expenses. Cash and cash equivalents Cash equivalents consist of highly liquid investments with an original maturity when purchased of three months or less and are stated at cost, which approximates fair value. Inventories Inventories are stated at the lower of cost (primarily computed in accordance with the first-in, first-out method) or net realizable value. Elements of cost include materials, labor, and overhead. Bulk wine inventories are included as in-process inventories within current assets, in accordance with the general practices of the wine industry, although a portion of such inventories may be aged for periods greater than one year. A substantial portion of barreled whiskey and brandy will not be sold within one year because of the duration of the aging process. All barreled spirits are classified as in-process inventories and are included in  Constellation Brands, Inc. FY 2023 Form 10-K #WORTHREACHINGFOR I 71  PART II ITEM 8. FINANCIAL STATEMENTS AND SUPPLEMENTARY DATA current assets, in accordance with industry practice. Warehousing, insurance, value added taxes, and other carrying charges applicable to barreled spirits held for aging are included in inventory costs. We assess the valuation of our inventories and reduce the carrying value of those inventories that are obsolete or in excess of our forecasted usage to their estimated net realizable value based on analyses and assumptions including, but not limited to, historical usage, future demand, and market requirements. Property, plant, and equipment Property, plant, and equipment is stated at cost. Major additions and improvements are recognized as an increase to the property accounts, while maintenance and repairs are expensed as incurred. The cost of properties sold or otherwise disposed of and the related accumulated depreciation are eliminated from the balance sheet accounts at the time of disposal and resulting gains and losses are included as a component of operating income. Interest incurred relating to expansion, optimization, and construction of facilities is capitalized to construction in progress. We cease the capitalization of interest when construction activities are substantially completed and the facility and related assets are available for their intended use. At this point, construction in progress is transferred to the appropriate asset class. Depreciation Depreciation is computed primarily using the straight-line method over the following estimated useful lives:  Years Land improvements 15 to 32 Vineyards 16 to 26 Buildings and improvements 10 to 50 Machinery and equipment 3 to 35 Motor vehicles 3 to 8 Derivative instruments We enter into derivative instruments to manage our exposure to fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates, commodity prices, and interest rates. We enter into derivatives for risk management purposes only, including derivatives designated in hedge accounting relationships as well as those derivatives utilized as economic hedges. We do not enter into derivatives for trading or speculative purposes. We recognize all derivatives as either assets or liabilities and measure those instruments at estimated fair value (see Notes 6 and 7). We present our derivative positions gross on our balance sheets. The change in the fair value of outstanding cash flow hedges is deferred in stockholders’ equity as a component of AOCI. For all periods presented herein, gains or losses deferred in stockholders’ equity as a component of AOCI are recognized in our results of operations in the same period in which the hedged items are recognized and on the same financial statement line item as the hedged items. Changes in fair values for derivative instruments not designated in a hedge accounting relationship are recognized directly in our results of operations each period and on the same financial statement line item as the hedged item. For purposes of measuring segment operating performance, the net gain (loss) from the changes in fair value of our undesignated commodity derivative contracts, prior to settlement, is reported outside of segment operating results until such time that the underlying exposure is recognized in the segment operating results. Upon settlement, the net gain (loss) from the changes in fair value of the undesignated commodity derivative contracts is reported in the appropriate operating segment, allowing our operating segment results to reflect the economic effects of the commodity derivative contracts without the resulting unrealized mark to fair value volatility.  Constellation Brands, Inc. FY 2023 Form 10-K #WORTHREACHINGFOR I 72  PART II ITEM 8. FINANCIAL STATEMENTS AND SUPPLEMENTARY DATA Cash flows from the settlement of derivatives, including both economic hedges and those designated in hedge accounting relationships, appear on our statements of cash flows in the same categories as the cash flows of the hedged items. Fair value of financial instruments We calculate the estimated fair value of financial instruments using quoted market prices whenever available. When quoted market prices are not available, we use standard pricing models for various types of financial instruments (such as forwards, options, swaps, and convertible debt) which take into account the present value of estimated future cash flows (see Note 7). Goodwill and other intangible assets Goodwill is allocated to the reporting unit in which the business that created the goodwill resides. A reporting unit is an operating segment, or a business unit one level below that operating segment, for which discrete financial information is prepared and regularly reviewed by segment management. We review our goodwill and indefinite-lived intangible assets annually for impairment, or sooner, if events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of an asset may not be recoverable. We use January 1 as our annual impairment test measurement date. Indefinite-lived intangible assets consist principally of trademarks. Intangible assets determined to have a finite life, primarily customer relationships, are amortized over their estimated useful lives and are subject to review for impairment when events or circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of an asset may not be recoverable. Note 9 provides a summary of intangible assets segregated between amortizable and nonamortizable amounts. Income taxes We use the asset and liability method of accounting for income taxes. This method accounts for deferred income taxes by applying statutory rates in effect at the balance sheet date to the difference between the financial reporting and tax bases of assets and liabilities. Certain income earned by foreign subsidiaries is subject to GILTI, a U.S. tax on foreign earnings. We treat the tax effect of GILTI as a current period tax expense when incurred. We provide deferred income taxes, consisting primarily of foreign withholding and state taxes, on all applicable unremitted earnings of our foreign subsidiaries. Interest and penalties are recognized as a component of (provision for) benefit from income taxes. We recognize a tax benefit from an uncertain tax position when it is more likely than not the position will be sustained upon examination. We measure and recognize the tax benefit from such a position based on the largest benefit that has a greater than 50% likelihood of being realized upon ultimate settlement. Due to the complexity of some of these uncertainties, the ultimate resolution may result in a payment that is materially different from our current estimate of the unrecognized tax benefit liabilities. In addition, changes in existing tax laws or rates could significantly change our current estimate of our unrecognized tax benefit liabilities. These differences will be reflected as increases or decreases to income tax expense in the period in which they are determined. Changes in current estimates, if significant, could have a material adverse impact on our financial statements. Leases We recognize right-of-use assets and lease liabilities on our balance sheet. We assess service arrangements to determine if an asset is explicitly or implicitly specified in the agreement and if we have the right to control the use of the identified asset. The right-of-use asset and lease liability are initially measured at the present value of future lease payments, discounted using the interest rate implicit in the lease or, if that rate cannot be readily determined, our secured incremental borrowing rate. The incremental borrowing rates are determined using a portfolio approach based on publicly available information in connection with our unsecured borrowing rates. We elected to recognize expenses for leases with a term of 12 months or less on a straight-line basis over the lease term and not to recognize these short-term leases on the balance sheet. The right-of-use asset and lease liability are calculated including options to extend or to terminate the lease when we determine that it is reasonably certain that we will exercise those options. In making that  Constellation Brands, Inc. FY 2023 Form 10-K #WORTHREACHINGFOR I 73  PART II ITEM 8. FINANCIAL STATEMENTS AND SUPPLEMENTARY DATA determination, we consider various existing economic and market factors, business strategies as well as the nature, length, and terms of the agreement. Based on our evaluation using these factors, we concluded that the exercise of renewal options or early termination options would not be reasonably certain in determining the lease term at commencement for leases we currently have in place. Assumptions made at the commencement date are re-evaluated upon occurrence of certain events such as a lease modification. Certain of our contractual arrangements may contain both lease and non-lease components. We elected to measure the lease liability by combining the lease and non-lease components as a single lease component for all asset classes. Certain of our leases include variable lease payments, including payments that depend on an index or rate, as well as variable payments for items such as raw materials, labor, property taxes, insurance, maintenance, and other operating expenses associated with leased assets. Certain grape purchasing arrangements include variable payments based on actual tonnage and price of grapes. In addition, certain third-party logistics arrangements include variable payments that vary depending on throughput. Such variable lease payments are excluded from the calculation of the right-of-use asset and the lease liability and are recognized in the period in which the obligation is incurred. Indemnification liabilities ', 'We have indemnified respective parties against certain liabilities that may arise in connection with certain acquisitions and divestitures. Indemnification liabilities are recognized when probable and estimable and included in deferred income taxes and other liabilities (see Note 16). ', 'Stock-based employee compensation We have two stock-based employee compensation plans (see Note 18). We apply grant date fair-value-based measurement methods in accounting for our stock-based payment arrangements and recognize all costs resulting from stock-based payment transactions, net of expected forfeitures, ratably over the requisite service period. Stock-based awards are subject to specific vesting conditions, generally time vesting, or upon retirement, disability, or death of the employee (as defined by the plan), if earlier. For awards granted to retirement-eligible employees, we recognize compensation expense ratably over the period from the date of grant to the date of retirement-eligibility. Net income (loss) per common share attributable to CBI Effective November 10, 2022, we have one class of common stock with a material number of shares outstanding: Class A Stock. In addition, we have another class of common stock with an immaterial number of shares outstanding: Class 1 Stock. Prior to November 10, 2022, we had an additional class of common stock with a material number of shares outstanding: Class B Stock. For additional information on the classes of common stock and the Reclassification, see Note 17. For the years ended February 28, 2023, February 28, 2022, and February 28, 2021, we used the two-class method for the computation and presentation of net income (loss) per common share attributable to CBI (hereafter referred to as “net income (loss) per common share”) (see Note 19). The two-class method is an earnings allocation formula that calculates basic and diluted net income (loss) per common share for each class of common stock separately based on dividends declared and participation rights in undistributed earnings as if all such earnings had been distributed during the period. Under the two-class method, Class A Stock was assumed to receive a 10 % greater participation in undistributed earnings (losses) than Class B Stock, in accordance with the respective minimum dividend rights of each class of stock. Net income (loss) per common share – basic excluded the effect of common stock equivalents and was computed using the two-class method. Net income (loss) per common share – diluted for Class A Stock reflected the potential dilution that could result if securities or other contracts to issue common stock were exercised or converted into common stock. Net income (loss) per common share – diluted for Class A Stock was computed using the more dilutive of the if-converted or two-class method. For the years ended February 28, 2023, and February 28, 2022, net income (loss) per common share – diluted for Class A Stock was computed using the two-class method, until such conversion took place pursuant to the Reclassification. Net income (loss) per common  Constellation Brands, Inc. FY 2023 Form 10-K #WORTHREACHINGFOR I 74  PART II ITEM 8. FINANCIAL STATEMENTS AND SUPPLEMENTARY DATA share – diluted for Class B Stock was computed using the two-class method and did not assume conversion of Class B Stock into shares of Class A Stock. Net income (loss) per common share – diluted for Class A Stock was computed using the if-converted method for the year ended February 28, 2021, and assumes the exercise of stock options using the treasury stock method and the conversion of Class B Stock as this method was more dilutive than the two-class method. 2.

DERIVATIVE INSTRUMENTS Overview We are exposed to market risk from changes in foreign currency exchange rates, commodity prices, interest rates, and equity prices that could affect our results of operations and financial condition. The impact on our results and financial position and the amounts reported in our financial statements will vary based upon the currency, commodity, interest rate, and equity market movements during the period, the effectiveness and level of derivative instruments outstanding, and whether they are designated and qualify for hedge accounting. The estimated fair values of our derivative instruments change with fluctuations in currency rates, commodity prices, interest rates, and/or equity prices and are expected to offset changes in the values of the underlying exposures. Our derivative instruments are held solely to manage our exposures to the aforementioned market risks as part of our normal business operations. We follow strict policies to manage these risks and do not enter into derivative instruments for trading or speculative purposes. We have an investment in certain equity securities and other rights which provide us with the option to purchase an additional ownership interest in the equity securities of Canopy (see Note 10). This investment is included in securities measured at fair value and is accounted for at fair value, with the net gain (loss) from the changes in fair value of this investment recognized in income (loss) from unconsolidated investments (see Note 7). We expect to no longer have this investment if the Canopy Transaction is completed. The aggregate notional value of outstanding derivative instruments is as follows:  February 28, 2023 February 28, 2022 (in millions) Derivative instruments designated as hedging instruments Foreign currency contracts $ 1,969.5 \\xa0 $ 1,863.2 \\xa0 Pre-issuance hedge contracts $ — \\xa0 $ 100.0 \\xa0 Derivative instruments not designated as hedging instruments Foreign currency contracts $ 831.7 \\xa0 $ 497.6 \\xa0 Commodity derivative contracts $ 416.5 \\xa0 $ 291.1 \\xa0  Constellation Brands, Inc. FY 2023 Form 10-K #WORTHREACHINGFOR I 79  PART II ITEM 8. FINANCIAL STATEMENTS AND SUPPLEMENTARY DATA Cash flow hedges Our derivative instruments designated in hedge accounting relationships are designated as cash flow hedges. We are exposed to foreign denominated cash flow fluctuations primarily in connection with third party and intercompany sales and purchases. We primarily use foreign currency forward contracts to hedge certain of these risks. In addition, we utilize interest rate swap, treasury lock, and swap lock contracts periodically to manage our exposure to changes in interest rates. Derivatives managing our cash flow exposures generally mature within three years or less, with a maximum maturity of five years . To qualify for hedge accounting treatment, the details of the hedging relationship must be formally documented at inception of the arrangement, including the risk management objective, hedging strategy, hedged item, specific risk that is being hedged, the derivative instrument, how effectiveness is being assessed, and how ineffectiveness will be measured. The derivative must be highly effective in offsetting changes in the cash flows of the risk being hedged. Throughout the term of the designated cash flow hedge relationship on at least a quarterly basis, a retrospective evaluation and prospective assessment of hedge effectiveness is performed based on quantitative and qualitative measures. All components of our derivative instruments’ gains or losses are included in the assessment of hedge effectiveness. When we determine that a derivative instrument which qualified for hedge accounting treatment has ceased to be highly effective as a hedge, we discontinue hedge accounting prospectively. In the event the relationship is no longer effective, we recognize the change in the fair value of the hedging derivative instrument from the date the hedging derivative instrument became no longer effective immediately in our results of operations. We also discontinue hedge accounting prospectively when (i) a derivative expires or is sold, terminated, or exercised; (ii) it is no longer probable that the forecasted transaction will occur; or (iii) we determine that designating the derivative as a hedging instrument is no longer appropriate. When we discontinue hedge accounting prospectively, but the original forecasted transaction continues to be probable of occurring, the existing gain or loss of the derivative instrument remains in AOCI and is reclassified into earnings (losses) when the forecasted transaction occurs. When it becomes probable that the forecasted transaction will not occur, any remaining gain or loss in AOCI is recognized immediately in our results of operations. We expect $ 87.2 million of net gains, net of income tax effect, to be reclassified from AOCI to our results of operations within the next 12 months. Undesignated hedges ', 'Certain of our derivative instruments do not qualify for hedge accounting treatment; for others, we choose not to maintain the required documentation to apply hedge accounting treatment. These undesignated instruments are primarily used to economically hedge our exposure to fluctuations in the value of foreign currency denominated receivables and payables; foreign currency investments, primarily consisting of loans to subsidiaries and foreign-denominated investments, and cash flows related primarily to the repatriation of those loans or investments; and commodity prices, including aluminum, corn, diesel fuel, and natural gas prices. We primarily use foreign currency forward and option contracts, generally less than 12 months in duration, and commodity swap contracts, generally less than 36 months in duration, with a maximum maturity of four years , to hedge some of these risks. In addition, from time to time, we utilize interest rate swap contracts, generally less than six months in duration, to economically hedge our exposure to changes in interest rates associated with the financing of significant investments and acquisitions. Our derivative policy permits the use of undesignated derivatives as approved by senior management. ', 'Credit risk We are exposed to credit-related losses if the counterparties to our derivative contracts default. This credit risk is limited to the fair value of the derivative contracts. To manage this risk, we contract only with major financial institutions that have earned investment-grade credit ratings and with whom we have standard International Swaps and Derivatives Association agreements which allow for net settlement of the derivative contracts. We have also established counterparty credit guidelines that are regularly monitored. Because of these safeguards, we believe the risk of loss from counterparty default to be immaterial.  Constellation Brands, Inc. FY 2023 Form 10-K #WORTHREACHINGFOR I 80  PART II ITEM 8. FINANCIAL STATEMENTS AND SUPPLEMENTARY DATA In addition, our derivative instruments are not subject to credit rating contingencies or collateral requirements. As of February 28, 2023, the estimated fair value of derivative instruments in a net liability position due to counterparties was $ 2.0 million. If we were required to settle the net liability position under these derivative instruments on February 28, 2023, we would have had sufficient available liquidity on hand to satisfy this obligation.

FAIR VALUE OF FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS Authoritative guidance establishes a framework for measuring fair value, including a hierarchy for inputs used in measuring fair value that maximizes the use of observable inputs and minimizes the use of unobservable inputs by requiring that the most observable inputs be used when available. The hierarchy includes three levels: • Level 1 inputs are quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities; • Level 2 inputs include data points that are observable such as quoted prices for similar assets or liabilities in active markets, quoted prices for identical assets or similar assets or liabilities in markets that are not active, and inputs (other than quoted prices) such as volatility, interest rates, and yield curves that are observable for the asset or liability, either directly or indirectly; and • Level 3 inputs are unobservable data points for the asset or liability, and include situations where there is little, if any, market activity for the asset or liability.  Constellation Brands, Inc. FY 2023 Form 10-K #WORTHREACHINGFOR I 82  PART II ITEM 8. FINANCIAL STATEMENTS AND SUPPLEMENTARY DATA Fair value methodology The following methods and assumptions are used to estimate the fair value for each class of our financial instruments: Foreign currency and commodity derivative contracts The fair value is estimated using market-based inputs, obtained from independent pricing services, entered into valuation models. These valuation models require various inputs, including contractual terms, market foreign exchange prices, market commodity prices, interest-rate yield curves, and currency volatilities, as applicable (Level 2 fair value measurement). Interest rate swap and Pre-issuance hedge contracts The fair value is estimated based on quoted market prices from respective counterparties. Quotes are corroborated by using discounted cash flow calculations based upon forward interest-rate yield curves, which are obtained from independent pricing services (Level 2 fair value measurement). Canopy investment Equity securities, Warrants – The November 2018 Canopy Warrants consist of three tranches of warrants, including 88.5 million Tranche A Warrants expiring November 1, 2023, which are currently exercisable, 38.4 million Tranche B Warrants expiring November 1, 2026, and 12.8 million Tranche C Warrants expiring November 1, 2026. If the Canopy Transaction is completed we intend to surrender the November 2018 Canopy Warrants for cancellation. The inputs used to estimate the fair value of the November 2018 Canopy Warrants are as follows (1)(2) :  February 28, 2023 February 28, 2022 Tranche A Warrants (3) Tranche B Warrants (4) Tranche A Warrants (3) Tranche B Warrants (4) Exercise price (5) C$ 50.40 \\xa0 C$ 76.68 \\xa0 C$ 50.40 \\xa0 C$ 76.68 \\xa0 Valuation date stock price (6) C$ 3.17 \\xa0 C$ 3.17 \\xa0 C$ 9.04 \\xa0 C$ 9.04 \\xa0 Remaining contractual term (7) 0.7 years 3.7 years 1.7 years 4.7 years Expected volatility (8) 100.0 \\xa0 % 100.0 \\xa0 % 75.0 \\xa0 % 75.0 \\xa0 % Risk-free interest rate (9) 4.6 \\xa0 % 3.7 \\xa0 % 1.4 \\xa0 % 1.7 \\xa0 % Expected dividend yield (10) 0.0 \\xa0 % 0.0 \\xa0 % 0.0 \\xa0 % 0.0 \\xa0 % (1) The exercise price for the Tranche C Warrants is based on the VWAP Exercise Price. The Tranche C Warrants are not included in the table as there is no fair value assigned. (2) In connection with the Acreage Transaction, we obtained other rights which include a share repurchase credit. If Canopy has not purchased the lesser of 27,378,866 Canopy common shares, or C$ 1,583.0 million worth of Canopy common shares for cancellation between April 18, 2019, and two-years after the full exercise of the Tranche A Warrants, we will be credited an amount that will reduce the aggregate exercise price otherwise payable upon each exercise of the Tranche B Warrants and Tranche C Warrants. The credit will be an amount equal to the difference between C$ 1,583.0 million and the actual price paid by Canopy in purchasing its common shares for cancellation. The likelihood of receiving the share repurchase credit if we were to fully exercise the Tranche A Warrants is remote, therefore, no fair value has been assigned. (3) The fair value is estimated using the Black-Scholes option-pricing model (Level 2 fair value measurement). (4) The fair value is estimated using Monte Carlo simulations (Level 2 fair value measurement). (5) Based on the exercise price from the applicable underlying agreements. (6) Based on the closing market price for Canopy common shares on the TSX as of the applicable date. (7) Based on the expiration date of the warrants. (8) Based on consideration of historical and/or implied volatility levels of the underlying equity security and limited consideration of historical peer group volatility levels.  Constellation Brands, Inc. FY 2023 Form 10-K #WORTHREACHINGFOR I 83  PART II ITEM 8. FINANCIAL STATEMENTS AND SUPPLEMENTARY DATA (9) Based on the implied yield currently available on Canadian Treasury zero coupon issues with a remaining term equal to the expiration date of the applicable warrants. (10) Based on historical dividend levels. Debt securities – We have elected the fair value option to account for the Canopy Debt Securities. Interest income on the Canopy Debt Securities is calculated using the effective interest method and is recognized separately from the changes in fair value in interest expense. The Canopy Debt Securities have a contractual maturity of five years from the date of issuance but may be settled prior to maturity by either party upon the occurrence of certain events. The fair value is estimated using a binomial lattice option-pricing model (Level 2 fair value measurement), which includes an estimate of the credit spread based on market spreads using bond data as of the valuation date. In April 2023, we extended the maturity of the remaining Canopy Debt Securities by exchanging them for the 2023 Canopy Promissory Note. If the Canopy Amendment is authorized by Canopy’s shareholders, we maintain our intention to negotiate an exchange of the principal amount of the 2023 Canopy Promissory Note for Exchangeable Shares, although neither we nor Canopy has any binding obligation to do so. For additional information, refer to Note 10. The inputs used to estimate the fair value of the Canopy Debt Securities are as follows:  February 28, 2023 February 28, 2022 Conversion price (1) C$ 48.17 \\xa0 C$ 48.17 \\xa0 Valuation date stock price (2) C$ 3.17 \\xa0 C$ 9.04 \\xa0 Remaining term (3) 0.4 years 1.4 years Expected volatility (4) 100.0 \\xa0 % 75.0 \\xa0 % Risk-free interest rate (5) 4.6 \\xa0 % 1.4 \\xa0 % Expected dividend yield (6) 0.0 \\xa0 % 0.0 \\xa0 % (1) Based on the rate which the Canopy Debt Securities may be settled. In June 2022, the Canopy Debt Securities were amended to remove Canopy’s right to settle the Canopy Debt Securities on conversion into Canopy common shares. As a result, the Canopy Debt Securities may only be settled in cash. Prior to the June 2022 amendment, the Canopy Debt Securities could be settled, at Canopy’s option, in cash, Canopy common shares, or a combination thereof. (2) Based on the closing market price for Canopy common shares on the TSX as of the applicable date. (3) Based on the contractual maturity date of the notes. (4) Based on consideration of historical and/or implied volatility levels of the underlying equity security, adjusted for certain risks associated with debt securities, as appropriate. (5) Based on the implied yield currently available on Canadian Treasury zero coupon issues with a term equal to the remaining contractual term of the Canopy Debt Securities. (6) Based on historical dividend levels. Short-term borrowings Our short-term borrowings consist of our commercial paper program and the revolving credit facility under our senior credit facility. The revolving credit facility is a variable interest rate bearing note with a fixed margin, adjustable based upon our debt rating (as defined in our senior credit facility). For these short-term borrowings the carrying value approximates the fair value. Long-term debt The term loans under our term credit agreements are variable interest rate bearing notes with a fixed margin, adjustable based upon our debt rating. The carrying values approximate the fair value of the term loans. The fair value of the remaining fixed interest rate long-term debt is estimated by discounting cash flows using interest rates currently available for debt with similar terms and maturities (Level 2 fair value measurement).  Constellation Brands, Inc. FY 2023 Form 10-K #WORTHREACHINGFOR I 84  PART II ITEM 8. FINANCIAL STATEMENTS AND SUPPLEMENTARY DATA The carrying amounts of certain of our financial instruments, including cash and cash equivalents, accounts receivable, and accounts payable, approximate fair value as of February 28, 2023, and February 28, 2022, due to the relatively short maturity of these instruments. As of February 28, 2023, the carrying amount of long-term debt, including the current portion, was $ 11,296.0 million, compared with an estimated fair value of $ 10,236.0 million. As of February 28, 2022, the carrying amount of long-term debt, including the current portion, was $ 10,093.5 million, compared with an estimated fair value of $ 10,345.3 million.

FINANCIAL STATEMENTS AND SUPPLEMENTARY DATA Nonrecurring basis measurements The following table presents our assets and liabilities measured at estimated fair value on a nonrecurring basis for which an impairment assessment was performed for the periods presented:  Fair Value Measurements Using Quoted Prices in Active Markets (Level 1) Significant Other Observable Inputs (Level 2) Significant Unobservable Inputs (Level 3) Total Losses (in millions) For the Year Ended February 28, 2023 Equity method investments $ 398.4 \\xa0 $ — \\xa0 $ — \\xa0 $ 1,060.3 \\xa0 Long-lived assets — \\xa0 — \\xa0 6.3 \\xa0 53.5 \\xa0 Trademarks — \\xa0 — \\xa0 — \\xa0 13.0 \\xa0 $ 398.4 \\xa0 $ — \\xa0 $ 6.3 \\xa0 $ 1,126.8 \\xa0 For the Year Ended February 28, 2022 Long-lived assets $ — \\xa0 $ — \\xa0 $ 20.0 \\xa0 $ 665.9 \\xa0 For the Year Ended February 28, 2021 Long-lived assets held for sale $ — \\xa0 $ — \\xa0 $ — \\xa0 $ 24.0 \\xa0 Trademarks — \\xa0 — \\xa0 4.0 \\xa0 6.0 \\xa0 $ — \\xa0 $ — \\xa0 $ 4.0 \\xa0 $ 30.0 \\xa0 Equity method investments As of August 31, 2022, we evaluated the Canopy Equity Method Investment and determined there was an other-than-temporary impairment based on several contributing factors, including: (i) the period of time for which the fair value had been less than the carrying value and the uncertainty surrounding Canopy’s stock price recovering in the near-term, (ii) Canopy recording a significant impairment of goodwill related to its cannabis operations during its three months ended June 30, 2022, and (iii) the uncertainty of U.S. federal cannabis permissibility. As a result, the Canopy Equity Method Investment with a carrying value of $ 1,695.1 million was written down to its estimated fair value of $ 634.8 million, resulting in an impairment of $ 1,060.3 million. This loss from impairment was included in income (loss) from unconsolidated investments within our consolidated results for the year ended February 28, 2023. The estimated fair value was determined based on the closing price of the underlying equity security as of August 31, 2022. As of February 28, 2023, the estimated fair value was $ 398.4 million, as such, we evaluated the Canopy Equity Method Investment for an additional other-than-temporary impairment. If Canopy’s stock price does not recover above our carrying value in the near-term there may be a future impairment of the Canopy Equity Method Investment. For additional information, refer to Note 10. Long-lived assets For the year ended February 28, 2023, in connection with certain continued negative trends within our Beer segment’s craft beer business, management updated its long-term financial forecasts for this business and determined it was no longer part of the beer asset group. This change in financial forecasts indicated it was more likely than not the fair value of our long-lived assets associated with the craft beer business might be below its carrying value. Accordingly, we performed a quantitative assessment for impairment. As a result, certain long-lived assets with a carrying value of $ 59.8 million were written down to their estimated fair value of $ 6.3 million, resulting in a total loss of $ 53.5 million. This loss was included in selling, general, and administrative expenses within our consolidated results of operations for the year ended February 28, 2023. These assets consisted primarily of property, plant, and equipment, including the Daleville Facility. Our estimated fair value was primarily based on the cash flows expected to be generated by the assets.  Constellation Brands, Inc. FY 2023 Form 10-K #WORTHREACHINGFOR I 86  PART II ITEM 8. FINANCIAL STATEMENTS AND SUPPLEMENTARY DATA In April 2021, our Board of Directors authorized management to sell or abandon the Mexicali Brewery. Subsequently, management determined that we will be unable to use or repurpose certain assets at the Mexicali Brewery. Accordingly, for the first quarter of Fiscal 2022, long-lived assets with a carrying value of $ 685.9 million were written down to their estimated fair value of $ 20.0 million, resulting in an impairment of $ 665.9 million. This impairment was included in impairment of brewery construction in progress within our consolidated results of operations for the year ended February 28, 2022. Our estimate of fair value was determined based on the expected salvage value of the assets. The Mexicali Brewery is a component of the Beer segment. In April 2022, we announced that, with the assistance of the Mexican government and state and local officials in Mexico, we acquired land in Veracruz for the construction of the Veracruz Brewery where there is ample water and we will have a skilled workforce to meet our long-term needs. The design and construction process for the Veracruz Brewery is underway. In the medium-term, under normal operating conditions, we have ample capacity at our current Mexican breweries to meet consumer needs based on current growth forecasts and current and planned production capabilities. Expansion, optimization, and/or construction activities continue at our breweries in Mexico to align with our anticipated future growth expectations. Long-lived assets held for sale For the year ended February 28, 2021, primarily in connection with the Wine and Spirits Divestitures and the Concentrate Business Divestiture, long-lived assets held for sale with a carrying value of $ 736.4 million were written down to their estimated fair value of $ 712.4 million, less costs to sell, resulting in a total loss of $ 24.0 million. This loss was included in selling, general, and administrative expenses within our consolidated results of operations. These assets consisted primarily of goodwill, intangible assets, and certain winery and vineyard assets which had satisfied the conditions necessary to be classified as held for sale. Our estimated fair value was determined as of November 30, 2020, primarily based on the expected proceeds from the Wine and Spirits Divestitures and the Concentrate Business Divestiture, excluding the then-potential contingent consideration. Trademarks For the year ended February 28, 2023, in connection with certain continued negative trends within our Beer segment’s Funky Buddha and Four Corners craft beer portfolios, management updated its long-term financial forecasts for these portfolios. As a result, the Funky Buddha and Four Corners craft beer trademark assets with a net carrying value of $ 13.0 million were written-off, resulting in an impairment of $ 13.0 million. This impairment was included in selling, general, and administrative expenses within our consolidated results of operations for the year ended February 28, 2023. For the year ended February 28, 2021, certain negative trends within our Beer segment’s Four Corners craft beer portfolio, including slower growth rates and increased competition, resulted in updated long-term financial forecasts. The updated forecasts indicated it was more likely than not the fair value of our indefinite-lived intangible asset associated with the Four Corners trademark might be below its carrying value. Accordingly, we performed a quantitative assessment for impairment. As a result of this assessment, the Four Corners trademark asset with a carrying value of $ 10.0 million was written down to its estimated fair value of $ 4.0 million, resulting in an impairment of $ 6.0 million. This impairment was included in selling, general, and administrative expenses within our consolidated results of operations for the year ended February 28, 2021. When performing a quantitative assessment for impairment of a trademark asset, we measure the amount of impairment by calculating the amount by which the carrying value of the trademark asset exceeds its estimated fair value. The estimated fair value is determined based on an income approach using the relief from royalty method, which assumes that, in lieu of ownership, a third party would be willing to pay a royalty in order to exploit the related benefits of the trademark asset. The cash flow projections we use to estimate the fair value of our trademark assets involve several assumptions, including (i) projected revenue growth rates, (ii) estimated royalty rates, (iii) after-tax royalty savings expected from ownership of the trademarks, and (iv) discount rates used to derive the estimated fair value of the trademark assets.

       "[' Supply of quality water, agricultural, and other raw materials, certain raw and packaging materials purchased under supply contracts; supply chain disruptions and inflation; limited group of glass bottle suppliers The quality and quantity of water available for use is important to the supply of our agricultural raw materials and our ability to operate our business. Water is a limited resource in many parts of the world. If climate patterns change and droughts continue or become more severe or other restrictions on currently available water resources are imposed, there may be a scarcity of water or poor water quality which may affect our and our suppliers&#8217; operations, increase production costs, or impose capacity constraints. We are dependent on sufficient amounts of quality water for operation of our breweries, wineries, and distilleries, as well as to irrigate our vineyards and conduct our other operations. The suppliers of the agricultural raw materials we purchase are also dependent upon sufficient supplies of quality water for their vineyards and fields. In addition, water purification and waste treatment infrastructure limitations could increase costs or constrain operation of our production facilities and vineyards. A substantial reduction in water supplies could result in material losses of grape crops and vines or other crops, such as corn, barley, or hops, which could lead to a shortage of our product supply. We have substantial brewery operations in Mexico and substantial wine operations in the U.S. (primarily in California), New Zealand, and Italy as well as brewery and distillery operations in the U.S. Although certain areas in California have recently experienced flooding, the state has endured and may continue to experience prolonged drought conditions which have resulted in the imposition of certain restrictions on water usage. If these conditions or restrictions persist and/or increase in severity, it could have an adverse effect upon those operations. Our current Mexican breweries are each, and the Veracruz Brewery will be, sourced from a single water supply originating from separate and distinct aquifers. The sources of water, methods of water delivery, water quality, or water requirements to support our ongoing requirements may change materially in the future. We may incur additional expenses for improving water delivery, quality, and efficiency as well as for securing additional water sources. Our breweries, the Glass Plant, our wineries, and our distilleries use a large volume of agricultural and other raw materials to produce our products. These include corn starch and sugars, malt, hops, fruits, yeast, and water for our breweries; soda ash and silica sand for the Glass Plant; grapes and water for our wineries; and grain and water for our distilleries. Our breweries, wineries, and distilleries all use large amounts of various packaging materials, including glass, aluminum, cardboard, and other paper products. Our production facilities also use electricity, natural gas, and diesel fuel in their operations. Certain raw materials and packaging materials are purchased under contracts of varying maturities. The supply, on-time availability, and price of raw, packaging, and other materials, energy, and other commodities have been and may continue to be affected by many factors beyond our control, including supply chain disruptions, inflationary pressures, market demand, global geopolitical events and military conflicts, such as repercussions from the Russian invasion of Ukraine, droughts, storms, weather events, or natural or man-made disasters, economic factors affecting growth decisions, plant diseases, and theft. For example, we have experienced a lack of availability and increased costs of ocean freight shipping containers and delays at sea and land ports which has impacted and could continue to impact our distribution and production capabilities. Our breweries, wineries, and distilleries are also dependent upon an adequate supply of glass bottles. We have experienced glass bottle purchasing shortages, particularly for brown glass used for certain of our Mexican beer brands. Glass bottle costs are one of our largest components of cost of product sold. The Glass Plant produces a majority of the total annual glass bottle supply for our Mexican beer brands, and we have a small number of other suppliers of glass bottles for our Mexican beer brands. In the U.S., glass bottles have only a small ##TABLE_START Constellation Brands, Inc. FY 2023 Form 10-K #WORTHREACHINGFOR I 16 ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START PART I ITEM 1A.

Currently, one producer supplies a majority of our glass container requirements for our U.S. wine and spirits operations while a different producer supplies the glass bottles for our craft beer operations. To the extent any of the foregoing factors (i) increases the costs of our products and we are unable or choose not to pass along such rising costs to consumers through increased selling prices or (ii) leads to a shortage of our product supply or inventory levels, we could experience a material adverse effect on our business, liquidity, financial condition, and/or results of operations. Reliance upon complex information systems and third-party global networks; cyberattacks We depend on IT to enable us to operate efficiently and interface with customers and suppliers, maintain financial accuracy and efficiency, and effect accurate and timely governmental reporting. If we do not allocate and effectively manage the resources necessary to build and sustain the proper technology infrastructure, including our global ERP, we could be subject to transaction errors, processing inefficiencies, increased costs, loss of customers, business disruptions, loss of or damage to intellectual property through security breach, penalties associated with the failure to timely file governmental reports, and/or other difficulties. Many groups on a worldwide basis have experienced increases in electronic security breaches, cyberattacks, and other hacking activities such as denial of service, malware, and ransomware, and there is the possibility of retaliatory cyberattacks, including by state-sponsored organizations. As with all large IT systems, we have been a target of cyberattackers and other hacking activities and our systems could be penetrated by increasingly sophisticated parties intent on extracting confidential or proprietary information, corrupting our information, disrupting our business processes, engaging in the unauthorized use of strategic information about us or our employees, customers, or consumers, or demanding monetary payment. Such unauthorized access could disrupt our operations and could result in various costs and adverse consequences, including the loss of assets or revenues, litigation, regulatory actions, remediation costs, increased cybersecurity protection costs, damage to our reputation, harm to our employees, or the failure by us to retain or attract customers following such an event. We have outsourced various functions to third-party service providers and may outsource other functions in the future. We rely on such third-parties to provide services on a timely and effective basis, but we do not ultimately control their performance. In addition, our distributors, wholesalers, suppliers, joint venture partners, and other external business partners utilize their own IT systems that are subject to similar risks to us as described above. Their failure to perform as expected or as required by contract, or additional cyberattacks on them that disrupts their systems, could result in significant disruptions and costs to our operations or, in the case of third-party service providers, a penetration of our systems. To the extent any of the foregoing factors result in significant disruptions and costs to our operations or reduce the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting, it could have a material adverse effect on our business, liquidity, financial condition, and/or results of operations. Economic and other uncertainties associated with our international operations We have production facilities in the U.S., Mexico, New Zealand, and Italy and employees in various countries, and our products are sold in numerous countries. The countries in which we operate impose duties, excise taxes, and/or other taxes on beverage alcohol products, and/or on certain raw materials used to produce our beverage alcohol products, in varying amounts. Governmental bodies may propose changes to international trade agreements, treaties, tariffs, taxes, and other government rules and regulations including but not limited to environmental treaties and regulations. Escalating geopolitical tensions, including from the military conflict in Ukraine, have resulted and may continue to result in sanctions, tariffs, and import-export restrictions. These activities, when combined with any retaliatory actions that may be taken by other countries, including Russia, could cause further inflationary pressures and economic and supply chain disruptions (including impacts on prices and supply of certain commodities, such as aluminum, corn, crude oil, natural gas, and steel). Significant increases in import and excise duties or other taxes on, or that impact, beverage alcohol products as well as any tariffs, particularly on imports from Mexico and any retaliatory tariffs imposed by the Mexican government, could have a material adverse effect on our business, liquidity, financial condition, and/or results of operations. In addition, governmental agencies extensively regulate the beverage alcohol products industry concerning such matters as licensing, warehousing, trade and pricing practices, permitted and required labeling, ##TABLE_START Constellation Brands, Inc. FY 2023 Form 10-K #WORTHREACHINGFOR I 17 ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START PART I ITEM 1A. RISK FACTORS ##TABLE_ENDadvertising, and relations with wholesalers and retailers. Certain regulations also require warning labels and signage. We may be subject to new or revised regulations, increased licensing fees, requirements, or taxes, or regulatory enforcement actions. Additionally, various jurisdictions may seek to adopt significant additional product labeling or warning requirements or limitations on the marketing or sale of our products because of what our products contain or allegations that our products cause adverse health effects. If these types of requirements become applicable to one or more of our major products under current or future laws or regulations, they may inhibit sales of such products. These uncertainties and changes, as well as the decisions, policies, and economic strength of our suppliers and distributors, could have a material adverse effect on our business, liquidity, financial condition, and/or results of operations. Dependence on limited facilities for production of our Mexican beer brands; facility expansion, optimization, and construction activities We are dependent on our current Mexican breweries to fulfill our Mexican beer brands&#8217; production requirements, both now as well as for the near-term. Expansion, optimization, and/or construction activities continue at our breweries in Mexico. These are multi-billion-dollar activities with risks of completion delays, cost overruns, and asset impairments, such as the prior impairment of certain long-lived assets at the canceled Mexicali Brewery. We may not achieve the intended financial and operational benefits of these investments, including if we develop excess capacity that outpaces demand for our Mexican beer brands. We are pursuing the sale of the remaining assets at the Mexicali Brewery after exploring various options; however, we may not be successful in completing any such sale or obtaining other forms of recovery. Expansion and optimization of current production facilities and construction of new production facilities are subject to various regulatory and developmental risks, including but not limited to: (i) our ability to obtain timely certificate authorizations, necessary approvals and permits from regulatory agencies at all or on terms that are acceptable to us; (ii) potential changes in federal, state, and local laws and regulations, including environmental requirements, that prevent a project from proceeding or increase the anticipated cost of the project; (iii) our inability to acquire rights-of-way or land or water rights on a timely basis on terms that are acceptable to us; or (iv) our inability to acquire the necessary energy supplies, including electricity, natural gas, and diesel fuel. Any of these or other unanticipated events could halt or delay the expansion, optimization, or construction of our production facilities. We may not be able to satisfy our product supply requirements for the Mexican beer brands in the event of (i) a significant disruption or the partial or total destruction of the current Mexican breweries or the Glass Plant, (ii) difficulty shipping raw materials and product into or out of the U.S., or (iii) a temporary inability to produce our product due to closure or lower production levels of one or more of our current Mexican breweries. Also, if the contemplated expansion, optimization, and/or construction activities at our breweries in Mexico are abandoned or not otherwise completed by their targeted completion dates, we may not be able to produce sufficient quantities of our Mexican beer to satisfy our needs in the future. Under such circumstances, we may be unable to obtain our Mexican beer at a reasonable price from another source, if at all. A significant disruption at our current Mexican breweries, or the Glass Plant, even on a short-term basis, could impair our ability to produce and ship products to market on a timely basis. Alternative facilities with sufficient capacity or capabilities may not readily be available, may cost substantially more, or may take a significant time to start production, any of which could have a material adverse effect on our product supply, business, liquidity, financial condition, and/or results of operations. Operational disruptions or catastrophic loss to breweries, wineries, other production facilities, or distribution systems All of our Mexican beer products are produced at our current Mexican breweries. Many of the workers at these breweries are covered by collective bargaining agreements. The Glass Plant produces a majority of the total annual glass bottle supply for our Mexican beer brands. Several of our vineyards and production and distribution facilities, including certain California and Oregon wineries, are in areas prone to seismic activity. Additionally, we have various vineyards and wineries in California and Oregon which have experienced wildfires, landslides, and/or severe winter storms. ##TABLE_START Constellation Brands, Inc. FY 2023 Form 10-K #WORTHREACHINGFOR I 18 ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START PART I ITEM 1A. RISK FACTORS ##TABLE_ENDIf any of these or other of our properties and production facilities were to experience a significant operational disruption or catastrophic loss, it could delay or disrupt production, shipments, and revenue, and result in potentially significant expenses to repair or replace these properties or find suitable alternative providers. Also, our production facilities are asset intensive. As our operations are concentrated in a limited number of production and distribution facilities, we are more likely to experience a significant operational disruption or catastrophic loss in any one location from acts of war or terrorism, natural or man-made disasters, public health crises, labor strikes or other labor activities, cyberattacks and other attempts to penetrate our or our third-party service providers&#8217; IT systems or the IT used by our non-production employees who work remotely, or unavailability of raw or packaging materials. Geopolitical and economic responses to Russia&#8217;s invasion of Ukraine could continue to impact global energy prices and supply, particularly for crude oil and natural gas. If a significant operational disruption or catastrophic loss were to occur, we could breach agreements, our reputation could be harmed, and our business, liquidity, financial condition, and/or results of operations could be adversely affected by, among other items, higher maintenance charges, unexpected capital spending, or product supply constraints. Our insurance policies do not cover certain types of catastrophes and may not cover certain events such as pandemics. Economic conditions and uncertainties in global markets may adversely affect the cost and other terms upon which we are able to obtain property damage and business interruption insurance. If our insurance coverage is adversely affected, or to the extent we have elected to self-insure, we may be at greater risk that we may experience an adverse impact to our business, liquidity, financial condition, and/or results of operations. Climate change; ESG regulatory compliance; failure to meet emissions, stewardship, and other ESG targets Our business depends upon agricultural activity and natural and human capital resources. There has been much public discussion related to concerns that GHGs may have an adverse impact on global temperatures, weather patterns, and the frequency and severity of extreme weather and natural disasters. Severe weather events and natural disasters, such as our experiences with drought, flooding, and/or wildfires in California and Oregon, severe winter storms in California, Texas, or Mexico, or late frosts or flooding in New Zealand, and climate change may negatively affect agricultural productivity in the regions from which we source our various agricultural raw materials or the energy powering our production facilities. Decreased availability of our raw materials may increase our cost of product sold. Severe weather events and natural disasters or changes in their frequency or intensity can also impact product quality; disrupt our supply chains, which may affect production operations, insurance cost and coverage, and delivery of our products to wholesalers, retailers, and consumers; and negatively affect the ability of consumers to purchase our products. The landscape related to ESG regulation, compliance, and reporting is constantly evolving, including expanding in scope and complexity. For example, the SEC and the European Commission have published proposed or final rules that would require significantly increased disclosures related to climate change. We may experience significant future increases in the costs associated with regulatory compliance for ESG matters, including fees, licenses, reporting, and the cost of capital improvements for our operating facilities to meet environmental regulatory requirements, as well as to address other regulations, standards, frameworks, and ratings from various governmental entities and other stakeholders or activist campaigns. We have disclosed targets related to restoration of water withdrawals, Scope 1 and Scope 2 GHG emissions, and enhancing social equity within our industry and communities, and we may disclose new or updated ESG-related targets in the future. The achievement of such targets along with our broader value chain engagement efforts have required and will continue to require us and in some cases third parties with which we do business, such as our suppliers, to make investments and allocate resources. In addition, we may be party to various environmental remediation obligations arising in the normal course of our business or relating to historical activities of businesses we acquire. Due to regulatory complexities, governmental or contractual requirements, uncertainties inherent in litigation, and the risk of unidentified contaminants at our current and former properties, the potential exists for remediation, liability, indemnification, and other costs to differ materially from the costs that we have estimated. We may also incur costs associated with environmental compliance arising from events we cannot control, such as natural disasters. We may not allot sufficient resources to attain, and/or may not ultimately achieve, our ESG targets, and our costs in relation to any of the foregoing matters may exceed our projections, which could have a material adverse effect upon our business, liquidity, financial condition, and/or results of operations. ##TABLE_START Constellation Brands, Inc. FY 2023 Form 10-K #WORTHREACHINGFOR I 19 ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START PART I ITEM 1A. RISK FACTORS ##TABLE_ENDReliance on wholesale distributors, major retailers, and government agencies Local market structures and distribution channels vary worldwide. Within our primary market in the U.S., we offer a range of beverage alcohol products with generally separate distribution networks utilized for our beer portfolio and our wine and spirits portfolio. In the U.S., we sell our products principally to wholesalers for resale to retail outlets and directly to government agencies. We have an exclusive arrangement with one wholesaler that generates a large portion of our branded U.S. wine and spirits net sales, and we have one wholesaler for our beer portfolio which, through multiple entities, represents roughly one-fifth of our consolidated net sales. Wholesalers and retailers of our products offer products which compete directly with our products for retail shelf space, promotional support and consumer purchases, and wholesalers or retailers may give higher priority to products of our competitors. The replacement or poor performance of our major wholesalers, retailers, or government agencies could result in temporary or longer-term sales disruptions or could have a material adverse effect on our business, liquidity, financial condition, and/or results of operations. Contamination and degradation of product quality from diseases, pests, and weather and other conditions Contamination, whether arising accidentally or through deliberate third-party action, or other events that harm the integrity or consumer support for our brands, could adversely affect sales. Various diseases, pests, fungi, viruses, drought, frosts, wildfires, and certain other weather conditions or the effects of climate conditions, such as smoke taint sustained during the 2020 U.S. wildfires or the late frost experienced in New Zealand in calendar 2021, could affect the quality and quantity of barley, hops, grapes, and other agricultural raw materials available and decrease the supply and quality of our products. Similarly, power disruptions could adversely impact our production processes and the quality of our products. We or our suppliers of agricultural raw materials may not succeed in preventing contamination in existing or future vineyards, fields, or production facilities. Future government restrictions regarding the use of certain materials used in growing grapes or other agricultural raw materials may increase vineyard costs and/or reduce production of grapes or other crops. It is also possible that a supplier may not provide materials or product components which meet our required standards or may falsify documentation associated with the fulfillment of those requirements. Product contamination or tampering or the failure to maintain our standards for product quality, safety, and integrity, including with respect to raw materials, naturally occurring compounds, packaging materials, or product components obtained from suppliers, may also reduce demand for our products or cause production and delivery disruptions. Contaminants or other defects in raw materials, packaging materials, or product components purchased from third parties and used in the production of our beer, wine, or spirits products, or defects in the fermentation or distillation process could lead to low beverage quality as well as illness among, or injury to, consumers of our products and may result in reduced sales of the affected brand or all our brands. If any of our products become unsafe or unfit for consumption, are misbranded, or cause injury, we may have to engage in additional product recalls and/or be subject to liability and incur additional costs. Widespread or multiple product recalls or a significant product liability judgment or regulatory action could cause our products to be unavailable for a period, which could reduce consumer demand and brand equity and result in reputational harm. Outbreaks of communicable infections or diseases, pandemics, or other widespread public health crises in the markets in which our consumers or employees live and/or in which we or our distributors, retailers, and suppliers operate Communicable disease outbreaks, including the COVID-19 pandemic, and other widespread public health crises have resulted and could continue to result in disruptions and damage to our business caused by potential negative consumer purchasing behavior as well as disruption to our supply chains, production processes, and operations. Consumer purchasing behavior may be impacted by reduced consumption if consumers are unable to leave home or otherwise shop in a normal manner as a result of containment actions or other cancellations of public events and other opportunities to purchase our products, from venue closures or capacity restrictions, or from a reduction in consumer discretionary income due to reduced or limited work and layoffs. Supply disruption may result from restrictions on the ability of employees and others in the supply chain to travel and work, which may result from quarantines, individual illnesses, or border closures imposed by governments to deter the spread of communicable infections or diseases; determinations by us or our suppliers or distributors to temporarily ##TABLE_START Constellation Brands, Inc. FY 2023 Form 10-K #WORTHREACHINGFOR I 20 ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START PART I ITEM 1A. RISK FACTORS ##TABLE_ENDsuspend operations in affected areas; or other actions which restrict or otherwise negatively impact our ability to produce, package, and ship our products, our distributors&#8217; ability to distribute our products, or our suppliers&#8217; ability to provide us with raw, packaging, and other materials. Channels of entry may be closed or operate at reduced capacity, or transportation of product within a region or country may be limited, including due to travel restrictions or personal illness of workers. Our operations and the operations of our suppliers may become less efficient or otherwise be negatively impacted if our or their executive management or other key operational personnel are unable to work or if a significant percentage of our workforce is unable to work at all or at their normal production or other facility. A prolonged quarantine or border closure could result in temporary or longer-term disruptions of sales patterns, consumption and trade patterns, supply chains, production processes, and/or operations. Another widespread health crisis or the reemergence of severe COVID-19 pandemic conditions could negatively affect the economies and financial markets of many countries resulting in a global economic downturn which could negatively impact demand for our products and our ability to borrow money. Any of these events could have a material adverse effect on our business, liquidity, financial condition, and/or results of operations. Cannabis is currently illegal under U.S. federal law and in other jurisdictions; we do not control Canopy&#8217;s business or operations The ability of Canopy to achieve its business objectives is contingent, in part, upon the legality of the cannabis industry, Canopy&#8217;s compliance with regulatory requirements enacted by various governmental authorities, and Canopy obtaining all regulatory approvals, where necessary, for the production and sale of its products. The laws and regulations governing medicinal and adult-use cannabis are still developing, including in ways that we may not foresee. Canopy&#8217;s success will depend on, among other things, the ability of Canopy to operate successfully in the cannabis market space. There are also concerns about health issues associated with certain types of form factors for cannabis products, such as those used in inhalables. These issues may result in a less robust consumer demand for certain form factors. A robust cannabis consumer market may not develop consistent with our expectations, or consumers may choose not to purchase Canopy products. Although the Agriculture Improvement Act of 2018 took hemp and hemp derived cannabinoids out of the most restrictive class of controlled substances, cannabis remains a Schedule I controlled substance that is illegal under U.S. federal law. Even in those U.S. states in which the adult-use and/or medicinal use of cannabis has been legalized, its use remains a violation of U.S. federal law. Continuation of U.S. federal law in its current state regarding cannabis could limit the expansion of Canopy&#8217;s business into the U.S. Similar issues of illegality apply in other countries. Any amendment to or replacement of existing laws to make them more onerous, or delays in amending or replacing existing laws to liberalize the legal possession and use of cannabis, or delays in obtaining, or the failure to obtain, any necessary regulatory approvals may significantly delay or negatively impact Canopy&#8217;s markets, products, and sales. Our investment in Canopy could affect consumer perception of our existing brands and our reputation with various constituencies. We currently have the right to nominate four members of the Canopy board of directors. While we do not control Canopy&#8217;s business or operations, we do rely on Canopy&#8217;s internal controls and procedures for operation of that business. Nevertheless, our current financing arrangements require us to certify, among other things, that to our knowledge (i) Canopy is properly licensed and operating in accordance with Canadian laws in all material respects; (ii) Canopy does not knowingly or intentionally purchase, manufacture, distribute, import, and/or sell marijuana, or any other controlled substance in or from the U.S. or any other jurisdiction, in each case, where such purchase, manufacture, distribution, importation, or sale of marijuana or such other controlled substance is illegal, except in compliance with all applicable federal, state, local, or foreign laws, rules, and regulations; and (iii) Canopy does not knowingly or intentionally partner with, invest in, or distribute marijuana or any other controlled substance to any third-party that knowingly or intentionally purchases, sells, manufactures, or distributes marijuana or any other controlled substance in the U.S. or any other jurisdiction, in each case, where such purchase, sale, manufacture, or distribution of marijuana or such other controlled substance is illegal, except in compliance with all applicable federal, state, local, or foreign laws, rules, and regulations. If Canopy were to knowingly or intentionally violate any of these applicable laws and we became aware of such violation, we would be unable to make the required certification under our current financing arrangements, which could lead to a default under those financing arrangements. ##TABLE_START Constellation Brands, Inc.

       " ' Potential decline in the consumption of products we sell; dependence on sales of our Mexican beer brands Our business depends upon consumers&#8217; consumption of our beer, wine, and spirits brands, and sales of our Mexican beer brands in the U.S. are a significant portion of our business. Consumer preferences, behaviors, and sentiment may shift due to a variety of factors, including changes in taste preferences and leisure, dining, and beverage purchasing and consumption patterns, trends involving demographics and ESG matters, changing market dynamics including consumer-led premiumization and betterment trends, and perceived value. Further, a limited or general decline in consumption in one or more of our product categories could occur in the future due to a variety of factors, including: &#8226; a general decline in economic or geopolitical conditions; &#8226; inflation, including the impact of reduced discretionary income of consumers available to purchase our products and increased commodities and other costs; &#8226; concern about the health consequences of consuming beverage alcohol products, including betterment trends, and about drinking and driving or other safety considerations; &#8226; a general decline in the consumption of beverage alcohol products in on-premise establishments, including as a result of stricter laws relating to driving while under the influence of alcohol; &#8226; increased activity from anti-alcohol groups or other bodies, such as the World Health Organization, advocating measures designed to reduce the consumption of beverage alcohol products or require more stringent labeling; &#8226; increased excise or other taxes on beverage alcohol products and possible restrictions on beverage alcohol advertising and marketing; &#8226; increased regulation restricting the purchase or consumption of beverage alcohol products; and &#8226; wars, disease outbreaks or pandemics, quarantines, weather, and natural or man-made disasters. If these or any other factors cause a decline in the growth rate, amount, or profitability of our sales of the Mexican beer brands in the U.S. or any material shift in consumer preferences, behaviors, and sentiment in our major markets away from our beer, wine, and spirits brands, and our Mexican beer brands in particular, or from the categories in which they compete, it could adversely affect our business, liquidity, financial condition, and/or results of operations. Acquisition, divestiture, investment, and NPD strategies From time to time, we acquire businesses, assets, or securities of companies that we believe will provide a strategic fit with our business. We integrate acquired businesses with our existing operations; our overall internal control over financial reporting processes; and our financial, operations, and information systems. If the financial performance of our business, as supplemented by the assets and businesses acquired, does not meet our expectations, it may make it more difficult for us to service our debt obligations and our results of operations may fail to meet market expectations. We may not effectively assimilate the business or product offerings of acquired companies into our business or within the anticipated costs or timeframes, retain key customers and suppliers or key employees of acquired businesses, or successfully implement our business plan for the combined business. In addition, our final determinations and appraisals of the estimated fair value of assets acquired and liabilities assumed in our acquisitions may vary materially from earlier estimates and we may fail to fully realize anticipated cost savings, growth opportunities, or other potential synergies. The fair value of acquired businesses or investments may not remain constant. We also divest businesses, assets, or securities of companies from time to time, including those that we believe no longer provide a strategic fit with our business. We may provide various indemnifications in connection with divestitures of businesses or assets. Divestitures of portions of our business may also result in costs stranded in our remaining business. Delays in developing or implementing plans to address such costs could delay or prevent the accomplishment of our financial objectives. The amount of contingent consideration, if any, received in divestitures may also vary based on various factors including actual future brand performance. We have also acquired or retained ownership interests in companies which we do not control, such as our joint venture to operate the Glass Plant, our interest in Canopy, and investments made through our corporate venture capital function, and we have acquired control of companies which we do not wholly own, such as our ##TABLE_START Constellation Brands, Inc. FY 2023 Form 10-K #WORTHREACHINGFOR I 22 ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START PART I ITEM 1A. RISK FACTORS ##TABLE_END75% interest in Nelson&#8217;s Green Brier Distillery, LLC. Our joint venture partners or the other parties that hold the remaining ownership interests in companies which we do not control may at any time have economic, business, or legal interests or goals that are inconsistent with our goals or the goals of the joint ventures or those companies. Our joint venture arrangements and the arrangements through which we acquired or hold our other equity or membership interests may require us to, among other matters, pay certain costs, make capital investments, fulfill alone our joint venture partners&#8217; obligations, or purchase other parties&#8217; interests. The entities in which we have an interest may be subject to litigation which may have an adverse impact on their ability to do business or under which they may incur costs and expenses which could have a material adverse impact on their operations or financial condition which, in turn, could negatively impact the value of our investment. In addition, our continued success depends, in part, on our ability to develop new products. The launch and ongoing success of NPDs are inherently uncertain, especially with respect to consumer appeal and our ability to deliver optimized marketing in an evolving and dynamic media landscape. A new product launch can give rise to a variety of costs. An unsuccessful launch, among other things, can affect consumer perception of existing brands and our reputation. Unsuccessful implementation or short-lived popularity of our product innovations has resulted and may in the future result in inventory write-offs and other costs. We may not realize the expected benefits of acquisitions, divestitures, investments, or NPDs. We have recognized impairment losses and/or write-offs in connection with acquired and divested businesses and investments, and we may do so again in the future. Furthermore, our acquisitions, investments, or joint ventures may not be profitable, our forecasts regarding acquisition, divestiture, or investment activities may not be accurate, or the internal control over financial reporting of entities which we must consolidate as a result of our investment activities but do not control or wholly own may not be as robust as our internal control over financial reporting. Our failure to adequately manage the risks associated with acquisitions, divestitures, investments, or NPDs, or the failure of an entity in which we have an equity or membership interest, could have a material adverse effect on our business, liquidity, financial condition, and/or results of operations. Dependence upon trademarks and proprietary rights, failure to protect our intellectual property rights Our future success depends significantly on our ability to protect our current and future brands and products and to defend our intellectual property rights. We have been granted numerous trademark registrations and use certain trademarks under license covering our brands and products, and we have filed, and expect to continue to file or have filed on our behalf, trademark applications seeking to protect newly developed brands and products. We cannot be sure that trademark registrations will be issued with respect to any of such trademark applications. We could also, by omission, fail to timely renew or protect a trademark and our competitors could challenge, invalidate, or circumvent any existing or future trademarks issued to, or licensed by, us. Our subsidiaries CB Brand Strategies, LLC, Crown Imports LLC, and Compa&#241;&#237;a Cervecera de Coahuila, S. de R.L. de C.V. are defendants in a lawsuit originally filed in U.S. District Court for the Southern District of New York on February 15, 2021, and most recently amended on March 16, 2022, by Cervecer&#237;a Modelo de M&#233;xico, S. de R.L. de C.V. and Trademarks Grupo Modelo, S. de R.L. de C.V., which alleges, among other things, that our sub-license of the trademarks for our Mexican beer brands should not permit us to use the Corona brand name on our Corona Hard Seltzer or the Modelo brand name on our Modelo Ranch Water. On August 5, 2022, both the plaintiffs and the defendants filed motions for summary judgment. On November 3, 2022, the court denied our motion for summary judgment. On December 13, 2022, the court denied plaintiffs&#8217; motion for summary judgment. At a trial in March 2023, the jury returned a unanimous verdict in our favor on all counts in the plaintiffs&#8217; complaint, and the court entered judgment dismissing the complaint on March 15, 2023. On April 12, 2023, the plaintiffs filed a motion for judgment as a matter of law or, in the alternative, for a new trial with the court, which motion was denied on April 14, 2023. While we continue to believe this lawsuit is without merit, litigation is inherently unpredictable and subject to substantial uncertainties and unfavorable developments and resolutions could occur. In addition, our cost of defending this litigation has been and could continue to be substantial. If we are not successful, we may not be able to market Corona Hard Seltzer in its current formulation under the Corona brand name or Modelo Ranch Water product in its current formulation under the Modelo brand name and we may be required to pay damage awards, each of which may have an adverse effect on our business, liquidity, financial condition and/or results of operations. ##TABLE_START Constellation Brands, Inc. FY 2023 Form 10-K #WORTHREACHINGFOR I 23 ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START PART I ITEM 1A. RISK FACTORS ##TABLE_ENDWe have been and may continue to be subject to other litigation related to our trademarks and intellectual property rights. A substantial adverse judgment or other unfavorable resolution of these matters or our failure to otherwise protect our intellectual property rights as well as the costs associated with such activities could have a material adverse effect on our business, liquidity, financial condition, and/or results of operations. The Canopy Transaction, which is designed to capitalize on U.S. cannabis market opportunities, may significantly alter our relationship with and investment in Canopy If the Canopy Transaction is completed and we exchange our Canopy common shares for Exchangeable Shares and terminate certain legacy agreements with Canopy, we and Canopy will no longer be able to derive benefits from our strategic relationship. The Exchangeable Shares will not carry (i) voting rights which will limit our ability to exert influence over Canopy (as will the termination of our rights under the investor rights agreement and the resignations of our nominees to Canopy&#8217;s board of directors) or (ii) rights to receive dividends or other rights upon dissolution of Canopy which will limit our right to derive economic benefits from our investment in Canopy if it declares dividends or dissolves and we continue to hold Exchangeable Shares. Furthermore, we expect to no longer apply the equity method of accounting to our investment in Canopy, which may subject our financial statements to additional volatility as we expect to account for the Exchangeable Shares at fair value. In connection with exchanging our Canopy common shares for Exchangeable Shares, we will also surrender our November 2018 Canopy Warrants to Canopy for cancellation, and therefore, we will not realize an opportunity to increase our ownership in Canopy if its stock price were to recover prior to their expiration. The perception of the Canopy Transaction by members of the investment community, whether or not it is completed, and the potential that Canopy may not remain listed on the stock exchanges it is currently listed on may result in a decrease in the value of Canopy&#8217;s common stock and further impair its liquidity and marketability. If the Canopy Transaction is not completed for any reason, including if Canopy fails to receive the requisite shareholder approval for the Canopy Amendment, Canopy will have expended substantial time and resources that could otherwise have been spent on Canopy&#8217;s existing businesses and the pursuit of other opportunities that could have been beneficial to Canopy. Canopy may not fully realize the anticipated benefits of the Canopy Transaction if it is completed. To the extent any of the foregoing factors impact Canopy, it could have a material adverse effect on Canopy&#8217;s business, liquidity, financial condition, and/or results of operations. Were that to occur, we may not be able to recover the remaining value of our investment in Canopy. In addition, if the Canopy Transaction is completed and the October 2022 Credit Agreement Amendments become effective, our financing arrangements will (i) restrict repayment of the loans under our credit agreements with proceeds derived, directly or indirectly, from Canopy prior to the Specified Time, (ii) restrict the use of proceeds from the loans under our credit agreements, directly or indirectly, for any investment in, transaction with, or to fund the activities of or business with Canopy prior to the Specified Time, and (iii) provide that we will not convert any of our outstanding Exchangeable Shares for Canopy common shares or own any Canopy common shares until the Specified Time. If the foregoing obligations become effective and we do not comply with them, we could trigger an event of default under such debt facilities or agreements. In such an event, the holders of our debt could elect to declare as due and payable all amounts outstanding under those instruments. An event of default could also result in events of default under other debt facilities or agreements that contain cross-acceleration or cross-default provisions, which could permit counterparties thereunder to exercise remedies. If that occurred, we might not have available funds to satisfy our repayment obligations. Our Canopy investment is dependent upon an emerging market and legal sales of cannabis products The legal cannabis market is an emerging market. The legislative framework pertaining to the Canadian cannabis market, as well as cannabis markets in the U.S. and other countries, is uncertain. Canopy&#8217;s success will depend on, among other things, its ability to create a strong platform to operate successfully in the cannabis market space and consumer demand for its products. A robust cannabis consumer market may not develop consistent with our expectations, or consumers may choose not to purchase Canopy products. The changing legal landscape and the limited amount of consumer market data makes it difficult to predict the pace at which the cannabis market may grow, if at all, and the products that consumers will purchase in the cannabis marketplace. For example, the Canadian Cannabis Act prohibits testimonials, lifestyle branding, and packaging that is appealing to youth. The restrictions on advertising, marketing, and the use of logos and brand names could have a material adverse effect on Canopy&#8217;s business, liquidity, financial condition, and/or results of ##TABLE_START Constellation Brands, Inc. FY 2023 Form 10-K #WORTHREACHINGFOR I 24 ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START PART I ITEM 1A. RISK FACTORS ##TABLE_ENDoperations, and our investment in Canopy. Additionally, Canopy must rely largely on its own market research and internal data to forecast industry trends and statistics as detailed forecasts may not be fully available from other sources. A failure in the demand for Canopy&#8217;s products to materialize as a result of consumer desire, competition from legal and illegal market entrants or other products, or other factors could have a material adverse effect on Canopy&#8217;s business, liquidity, financial condition, and/or results of operations and our investment in Canopy.

       " ' Indebtedness and interest rate fluctuations We have incurred indebtedness to finance investments and acquisitions, refinance other indebtedness, fund beer operations expansion, optimization, and construction activities, pay cash dividends, and repurchase shares of our common stock. In the future, we may continue to incur additional indebtedness for any or all of these activities as well as to fund other general corporate purposes. We are exposed to risks associated with interest rate fluctuations, and we have recently experienced a rising interest rate environment. We could experience further changes in our ability to manage fluctuations in interest rates, including for our variable interest rate debt outstanding or if we need to refinance indebtedness. In addition, our business may not generate sufficient cash flow from operations to meet all our debt service requirements, return value to stockholders such as through payment of dividends or repurchase of shares of our common stock, and fund our general corporate and capital requirements. Our current and future debt service obligations and covenants could have important consequences. These consequences include, or may include, the following: &#8226; our ability to obtain financing for future working capital needs, investments, acquisitions, or other purposes may be limited; &#8226; our funds available for operations, expansions, construction, dividends or other distributions, or share repurchases may be reduced because we dedicate a significant portion of our cash flow from operations to the payment of principal and interest on our indebtedness; &#8226; our ability to conduct our business could be limited by restrictive covenants; and &#8226; our vulnerability to adverse economic conditions may be greater than less leveraged competitors and, thus, our ability to withstand competitive pressures may be limited. Additionally, any failure to meet required payments on our debt, or failure to comply with any covenants in the instruments governing our debt, could result in an event of default under the terms of those instruments and a downgrade to our credit ratings. A downgrade to our credit ratings would increase our borrowing costs and could affect our ability to issue commercial paper. Certain of our debt facilities also contain change of control provisions which, if triggered, may result in an acceleration of our obligation to repay the debt. In addition, certain of our current and future debt and derivative financial instruments have, or in the future, could have interest rates that are tied to reference rates, such as SOFR. The volatility and availability of such reference rates, including establishment of alternative reference rates, is out of our control. Changes to or the unavailability of such rates or the manner for calculation of such reference rates, could result in increases to the cost of our debt. If we do not comply with the obligations contained in our senior credit facility, our existing or future indentures, or other loan agreements, we could be in default under such debt facilities or agreements. In such an event, the holders of our debt could elect to declare as due and payable all amounts outstanding under those instruments. An event of default could also result in events of default under other debt facilities or agreements that contain cross-acceleration or cross-default provisions, which could permit counterparties thereunder to exercise remedies. If that occurred, we might not have available funds to satisfy our repayment obligations. Accounting for Canopy securities and potential additional impairment of Canopy Equity Method Investment We currently account for our investment in Canopy under the equity method and recognize our equity in Canopy&#8217;s earnings or losses on a two-month lag. There may be an additional impairment of our Canopy Equity Method Investment if Canopy&#8217;s stock price does not recover above our carrying value in the near-term. In the event the Canopy Transaction and the transactions contemplated by the Consent Agreement are completed and we elect to convert our Canopy common shares into Exchangeable Shares, we expect to no longer apply the equity method to our investment in Canopy, which we expect will instead be accounted for at fair value. This may subject ##TABLE_START Constellation Brands, Inc. FY 2023 Form 10-K #WORTHREACHINGFOR I 25 ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START PART I ITEM 1A. RISK FACTORS ##TABLE_ENDour financial statements to additional volatility because the value of our Exchangeable Shares, including any received if we exchange our 2023 Canopy Promissory Note for Exchangeable Shares, would be subject to volatility factors that include but are not limited to: &#8226; actual or anticipated fluctuations in Canopy&#8217;s reported results of operations or financial position, including due to another significant impairment of goodwill or intangible or other long-lived assets; &#8226; adverse market conditions; &#8226; recommendations and reports by securities and industry analysts; &#8226; the outcome of the Canopy Transaction and related transactions; &#8226; significant acquisitions, investments, equity issuances, asset sales, or other divestitures by Canopy; &#8226; changes in the performance or market valuations of companies in Canopy&#8217;s industry; &#8226; announcement of developments and material events by Canopy or its competitors; &#8226; fluctuations in the costs of vital production materials and services; &#8226; addition or departure of Canopy executive officers or other key personnel; &#8226; speculative trading activity by certain investors; &#8226; news reports relating to trends, concerns, technological, or competitive developments, regulatory changes and other related issues in Canopy&#8217;s industry or target markets; &#8226; legal and regulatory changes affecting the cannabis industry generally and Canopy&#8217;s business and operations; and &#8226; administrative obligations associated with Health Canada requirements and compliance with all associated rules and regulations including, but not limited to, the Canadian Cannabis Act . Canopy&#8217;s corporate governance and valuation Canopy&#8217;s business is subject to evolving corporate governance and public disclosure regulations that may from time to time increase both Canopy&#8217;s compliance costs and the risk of its non-compliance. These include changing rules and regulations promulgated by a number of governmental and self-regulated organizations, including, but not limited to, the Canadian Securities Administrators, the TSX, the International Accounting Standards Board, the SEC, and Nasdaq. These rules continue to evolve in scope and complexity creating new requirements for Canopy. Canopy is required to comply with applicable Nasdaq listing standards and SOX requirements. In the future, Canopy&#8217;s internal controls may not be adequate, or Canopy may not be able to maintain adequate and effective internal controls over financial reporting as required by SOX, or on an ongoing basis if standards are modified, supplemented, or amended from time to time. If not maintained, investors could lose confidence in the reliability of its financial statements, which could harm Canopy&#8217;s business and have a negative impact on the trading price or market value of Canopy securities. In addition, we record as equity in earnings our proportional share of Canopy&#8217;s results of operations. We could have a material weakness in the event the proportional share of Canopy&#8217;s results of operations that we record contains an error as a result of an error in Canopy&#8217;s financial statements that we do not detect. Although we do not control Canopy, we do currently have significant influence over Canopy. If we controlled Canopy, we would have to consolidate Canopy into our financial statements, and if Canopy had a material weakness, we would inherit Canopy&#8217;s material weakness through consolidation. In such an event, even if Canopy&#8217;s financial statements were correct, the fact that Canopy had a material weakness could result in a material weakness for us. Class action or other litigation relating to abuse of our products, the misuse of our products, product liability, or marketing or sales practices, including product labeling There has been public attention directed at the beverage alcohol industry, which we believe is due to concerns related to harmful use of alcohol, including drinking and driving, underage drinking, and health consequences from the misuse of alcohol. We could be exposed to lawsuits relating to product liability or marketing or sales practices, including product labeling. Adverse developments in lawsuits related to such matters or a significant decline in the social acceptability of beverage alcohol products that may result from lawsuits could have a material adverse effect on our business, liquidity, financial condition, and/or results of operations. ##TABLE_START Constellation Brands, Inc.

       " ' The Reclassification may not benefit us or our stockholders The long-term impacts of the Reclassification are still unknown, and the Reclassification may not result in an increase in stockholder value or improve the liquidity and marketability of our equity. If the Reclassification is not viewed favorably by members of the investment community, it may cause a decrease in the value of our Class A Stock and impair its liquidity and marketability. Furthermore, securities markets worldwide have recently experienced significant price and volume fluctuations. This market volatility, as well as general economic, market, or political conditions, could cause a reduction in the market price and liquidity of shares of our Class A Stock. Sands Family Stockholder Class A Stock ownership and Board of Directors nomination rights Until the date that is five years after the Effective Time and so long as the Sands Family Stockholders, collectively, have beneficial or record ownership of at least 10% of the issued and outstanding shares of Class A Stock, our Board of Directors will, subject to the procedures and limitations set forth in the Reclassification Agreement, nominate two individuals designated by WildStar for election to our Board of Directors at any annual meeting of our stockholders at which directors are to be elected (or otherwise in connection with any action by written consent pursuant to which a majority of the Board of Directors will be elected). So long as the Sands Family Stockholders, collectively, have beneficial or record ownership of less than 10% but at least 9,239,463.1 shares of Class A Stock, as may be adjusted by any stock dividend, stock split, stock combination, or similar transaction, the Board of Directors will, subject to the procedures and limitations set forth in the Reclassification Agreement, nominate one individual designated by WildStar for election to the Board of Directors at any annual meeting of our stockholders at which directors are to be elected (or otherwise in connection with any action by written consent pursuant to which a majority of the Board of Directors will be elected). The amount of Class A Stock currently held by the Sands Family Stockholders, together with the foregoing Board of Directors nomination rights, provide the Sands Family Stockholders with significant continued influence over our decisions. The interests of the Sands Family Stockholders with respect to matters potentially or actually involving or affecting us and our other stockholders, such as future acquisitions, financings, and other corporate opportunities and attempts to acquire us, may conflict with the interests of our other stockholders. Certain Sands Family Stockholders have pledged shares of Class A Stock to secure various credit facilities. In the event of noncompliance with certain covenants under the credit facilities, the financial institutions to which such stock is pledged have certain remedies, including the right to sell the pledged shares subject to certain protections afforded to the borrowers and pledgors. The sale by such financial institutions of a substantial amount of the pledged shares could depress, or result in volatility in, the trading price of our Class A Stock. Choice-of-forum provision in our Amended and Restated By-laws regarding certain stockholder litigation Our Amended and Restated By-laws provide that, unless we consent in writing to the selection of an alternative forum, (i) the Court of Chancery of Delaware (or if such court lacks subject matter jurisdiction, the federal district court of Delaware) will be, to the fullest extent permitted by law, the sole and exclusive forum for any derivative action or proceeding brought on our behalf; any action asserting a claim of breach of a fiduciary duty owed by any of our current or former directors, officers, or stockholders to us or our stockholders; any action asserting a claim arising pursuant to any provision of the DGCL, our Amended and Restated Charter, or our Amended and Restated By-laws, or as to which the DGCL confers jurisdiction on the Court of Chancery of Delaware; or any action asserting a claim governed by the internal affairs doctrine, and (ii) the federal district courts of the U.S. will, to the fullest extent permitted by law, be the sole and exclusive forum for any complaint asserting a cause of action arising under the Securities Act. To the fullest extent permitted by law, this choice-of-forum provision will apply to state and federal law claims, including claims under the federal securities laws (including the Securities Act and the Exchange Act), although our stockholders will not be deemed to have waived our compliance with the federal securities laws and the rules and regulations thereunder. This choice-of-forum provision may increase costs for a stockholder pursuing any such claim, discourage claims, or limit a stockholder&#8217;s ability to bring a claim in a judicial forum that such stockholder finds favorable for disputes with us or our directors, officers, other stockholders, or other employees which may discourage such lawsuits even though an action, if successful, might benefit our stockholders. In addition, the courts located in Delaware may reach different judgments or results than would other courts, ##TABLE_START Constellation Brands, Inc.

RISK FACTORS ##TABLE_ENDincluding courts where a stockholder would otherwise choose to bring the action, and such judgments or results may be more favorable to us than to our stockholders. If a court were to find this choice-of-forum provision inapplicable or unenforceable in an action, we may incur additional costs associated with resolving such action in other jurisdictions which could adversely affect our business, liquidity, financial condition, and/or results of operations.

Unfavorable global or regional economic conditions, including economic slowdown or recession, instability in the banking sector, and the disruption, volatility, and tightening of credit and capital markets, as well as unemployment, tax increases, governmental spending cuts, or continuing high levels of inflation, could affect consumer spending patterns and purchases of our products. These could also create or exacerbate credit issues, cash flow issues, and other financial hardships for us and our suppliers, distributors, retailers, and consumers. The inability of suppliers, distributors, and retailers to access liquidity could impact our ability to produce and distribute our products. We could also be affected by nationalization of our international operations, unstable governments, unfamiliar or biased legal systems, intergovernmental disputes, or animus against the U.S. Any determination that our operations or activities did not comply with applicable U.S. or foreign laws or regulations could result in the imposition of fines and penalties, interruptions of business, terminations of necessary licenses and permits, and other legal and equitable sanctions. Damage to our reputation The success of our brands depends upon consumers&#8217; positive image of those brands, and maintaining a good reputation is critical to selling our branded products. Our reputation could also be impacted negatively by public perception, adverse publicity (whether or not valid, such as the similarity of the name of certain of our brands or trademarks and a type of virus), negative comments in social media, or our responses relating to: &#8226; a perceived or actual failure to maintain high ethical standards and responsible operating practices to achieve our business goals, including those related to our ESG and DEI strategies, initiatives, and targets as well as associated reporting regulations, standards, frameworks, and ratings; &#8226; a perceived or actual failure to address concerns relating to the quality, safety, or integrity of our products, including from accidental or deliberate contamination or tampering; ##TABLE_START Constellation Brands, Inc.

Failure to comply with applicable laws and regulations, maintain an effective system of internal controls, provide accurate and timely financial statement information, or protect our information systems against service interruptions, misappropriation of data, or breaches of security, could also hurt our reputation. Damage to our reputation or loss of consumer confidence in our products for any of these or other reasons could result in decreased demand for our products and could have a material adverse effect on our business, liquidity, financial condition, and/or results of operations, as well as require additional resources to rebuild our reputation, competitive position, and brand equity and renew investor confidence. Competition We operate in a highly competitive industry, and our sales and profitability could be negatively affected by numerous factors including: &#8226; our inability to maintain or increase prices or develop new products; &#8226; increases in our advertising or marketing expenditures to maintain our competitive position; &#8226; new entrants in our market or categories, including from the convergence of beverage categories; &#8226; the consolidation of distributors, wholesalers, retailers, suppliers, and other beverage companies; &#8226; the decision of wholesalers, retailers, or consumers to purchase competitors&#8217; products instead of ours; &#8226; pricing, purchasing, financing, operational, advertising, or promotional decisions made by wholesalers, state and local agencies, and retailers which affect supply of or consumer demand for our products; or &#8226; a general decline in beverage alcohol consumption due to consumer dietary preference changes or consumers substituting legalized cannabis or other similar products in lieu of beverage alcohol. Our continued success also depends on our ability to attract and retain a high-quality and diverse workforce in a competitive environment for talent and to implement our human capital priorities and initiatives. We could experience higher expenses for investment in our personnel, including due to employee turnover, continuing wage inflation, and other emerging employment trends, particularly in the U.S.; to deliver on our human capital priorities and initiatives; or for other reasons. We may be unable to increase our prices to pass along any increased costs we incur to our customers. Intangible assets, such as goodwill and trademarks We have a significant amount of intangible assets such as goodwill and trademarks and may acquire more intangible assets in the future. Intangible assets are subject to a periodic impairment evaluation under applicable accounting standards. The write-down of any of these intangible assets could have a material adverse effect on our business, liquidity, financial condition, and/or results of operations. Changes to tax laws, fluctuations in our effective tax rate, accounting for tax positions, the resolution of tax disputes, and changes to accounting standards, elections, assertions, or policies Changes to federal, state, provincial, local, or foreign tax laws, could result in increased taxes on our products, business, customers, or consumers. Various proposals to increase taxes on beverage alcohol products have been made at the federal and state levels or at other governmental bodies in recent years. Federal, state, provincial, local, or foreign governmental entities may consider increasing taxes upon beverage alcohol products as they explore available alternatives for raising funds, including to offset budget or other deficits. In addition, significant judgment is required to determine our effective tax rate and evaluate our tax positions. Our provision for income taxes includes a provision for uncertain tax positions. Fluctuations in federal, state, local, and foreign taxes, or a change to uncertain tax positions, including related interest and penalties, may ##TABLE_START Constellation Brands, Inc.

When tax matters arise, several years may elapse before such matters are audited and finally resolved. Unfavorable resolution of any tax matter could increase our effective tax rate and resolution of a tax issue may require the use of cash in the year of resolution. U.S. tax changes or changes in how international corporations are taxed, including changes in how existing tax laws are interpreted or enforced, or changes to accounting standards, elections, or assertions as well as our accounting policies could have a material adverse effect on our business, liquidity, financial condition, and/or results of operations. Cash dividends and share repurchases are subject to a number of uncertainties and may affect the price of our common stock Our capital allocation strategy contemplates quarterly cash dividends and periodic share repurchases under our share repurchase program. We fund our cash dividends and share repurchases through a combination of cash flow from operations, borrowings, and divestiture proceeds. However, we are not required to declare dividends or to make any share repurchases under our share repurchase program. We may discontinue, limit, suspend, delay, or increase our dividends and share repurchases at any time without prior notice. Even if not discontinued, the amount of such dividends and repurchases may be changed, and the amount, timing, and frequency of such dividends and repurchases may vary from historical practice or from our stated expectations. Decisions with respect to dividends and share repurchases are subject to the discretion of our Board of Directors and will be based on a variety of factors. Important factors that could cause us to discontinue, limit, suspend, delay, or increase our cash dividends or share repurchases include market conditions, the price of our common stock, the nature and timing of other investment opportunities, changes in our business strategy, the terms of our financing arrangements, our outlook as to our ability to obtain financing at attractive rates, the impact on our credit ratings, changes in laws or regulations, and the availability of cash. The IRA imposes an excise tax of 1% on share repurchases, effective January 1, 2023. The impact of this excise tax will be dependent on the extent of our share repurchases in future periods and could increase our tax liability. The reduction or elimination of our cash dividend or longer suspension or elimination of our share repurchase program could adversely affect the market price of our common stock. Additionally, any share repurchases may not enhance stockholder value because the market price of our common stock may decline below the levels at which we repurchased shares of common stock, and short-term stock price fluctuations could reduce the program&#8217;s effectiveness. ##TABLE_START Constellation Brands, Inc.

The IRA imposes an excise tax of 1% on share repurchases, effective January 1, 2023. The impact of this excise tax will be dependent on the extent of our share repurchases in future periods and could increase our tax liability. The reduction or elimination of our cash dividend or longer suspension or elimination of our share repurchase program could adversely affect the market price of our common stock. Additionally, any share repurchases may not enhance stockholder value because the market price of our common stock may decline below the levels at which we repurchased shares of common stock, and short-term stock price fluctuations could reduce the program&#8217;s effectiveness. ##TABLE_START Constellation Brands, Inc.

      "acquisitions: ['A company’s internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. A company’s internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that (i) pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company; (ii) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the company; and (iii) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the company’s assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements. ', 'Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate. \\n\\nCritical Audit Matters \\n\\nThe critical audit matters communicated below are matters arising from the current period audit of the consolidated financial statements that were communicated or required to be communicated to the audit committee and that (i) relate to accounts or disclosures that are material to the consolidated financial statements and (ii) involved our especially challenging, subjective, or complex judgments. The communication of critical audit matters does not alter in any way our opinion on the consolidated financial statements, taken as a whole, and we are not, by communicating the critical audit matters below, providing separate opinions on the critical audit matters or on the accounts or disclosures to which they relate. \\n\\nIndefinite-Life Intangible Assets Annual Impairment Assessments for Certain Brand Names \\n\\nAs described in Notes 1 and 6 to the consolidated financial statements, the Company’s consolidated indefinite-life intangible asset balance was $18.4 billion as of December 31, 2022, which consists principally of brand names. At least annually management assesses indefinite-life intangible assets for impairment and if significant potential impairment risk exists for a specific asset, management quantitatively tests the asset for impairment by comparing its estimated fair value with its carrying value. Management estimates fair value using several accepted valuation methods, including relief from royalty, excess earnings and excess margin, that utilize estimates of future sales, earnings growth rates, royalty rates and discount rates to determine a brand name’s fair value. \\n\\nThe principal considerations for our determination that performing procedures relating to the indefinite-life intangible assets annual impairment assessments for certain brand names is a critical audit matter are (i) the significant judgment by management when developing the fair value of the indefinite-life intangible assets for certain brand names; (ii) a high degree of auditor judgment, subjectivity, and effort in performing procedures and evaluating management’s significant assumptions related to estimates of future sales, earnings growth rates, royalty rates, and discount rates for certain brand names; and (iii) the audit effort involved the use of professionals with specialized skill and knowledge. \\n\\nAddressing the matter involved performing procedures and evaluating audit evidence in connection with forming our overall opinion on the consolidated financial statements. These procedures included testing the effectiveness of controls relating to the indefinite-life intangible assets impairment assessments, including controls over the annual valuation of certain brand names. These procedures also included, among others (i) testing management’s process for developing the fair value of the indefinite-life intangible assets for certain brand names; (ii) evaluating the appropriateness of the valuation methods; (iii) testing the completeness and accuracy of underlying data used in the valuation methods; and (iv) evaluating the reasonableness of the significant assumptions used by management related to estimates of future sales, earnings growth rates, royalty rates, and discount rates. Evaluating management’s significant assumptions related to estimates of future sales and earnings growth rates involved evaluating whether the assumptions used by management were reasonable considering (i) the current and past performance of the certain brand names; (ii) the consistency with external market and industry data; and (iii) whether these assumptions were consistent with evidence obtained in other areas of the audit. Professionals with \\n\\nTable of Contents \\n\\nspecialized skill and knowledge were used to assist in evaluating (i) the appropriateness of the Company’s valuation methods and (ii) the reasonableness of the royalty rate and discount rate significant assumptions. \\n\\nAcquisition of Clif Bar - Valuation of the Clif Trade Name \\n\\nAs described in Note 2 to the consolidated financial statements, on August 1, 2022, the Company acquired Clif Bar for purchase price consideration of $2.6 billion. Of the acquired indefinite life intangible assets, management allocated $1.45 billion to trade names, which primarily relate to the Clif trade name. The fair value for the Clif trade name was determined using the relief from royalty method. Significant assumptions used by management in assessing the fair value include estimates of future sales, discount and royalty rates. ', 'The principal considerations for our determination that performing procedures relating to the valuation of the Clif trade name acquired in the acquisition of Clif Bar is a critical audit matter are (i) the significant judgment by management when developing the fair value of the Clif trade name acquired; (ii) a high degree of auditor judgment, subjectivity, and effort in performing procedures and evaluating management’s significant assumptions related to estimates of future sales, discount and royalty rates; and (iii) the audit effort involved the use of professionals with specialized skill and knowledge. ', 'Addressing the matter involved performing procedures and evaluating audit evidence in connection with forming our overall opinion on the consolidated financial statement. These procedures included testing the effectiveness of controls related to acquisition accounting, including controls over management’s valuation of the Clif trade name acquired and controls over the development of significant assumptions related to estimates of future sales, discount and royalty rates. These procedures also included, among others (i) reading the purchase agreement; (ii) testing management’s process for developing the fair value of the Clif trade name acquired; (iii) testing the completeness and accuracy of the underlying data used in the relief from royalty method; and (iv) evaluating the reasonableness of the significant assumptions used by management related to estimates of future sales, discount and royalty rates. Evaluating management’s significant assumption related to estimates of future sales involved evaluating whether the assumption used by management was reasonable considering (i) the current and past performance of the Clif Bar business; (ii) the consistency with external market and industry data; and (iii) whether this assumption was consistent with evidence obtained in other areas of the audit. Professionals with specialized skill and knowledge were used to assist in evaluating (i) the appropriateness of the Company’s relief from royalty method and (ii) the reasonableness of the discount and royalty rate significant assumptions. \\n\\n/s/ PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP \\n\\nChicago, Illinois \\n\\nFebruary 3, 2023 \\n\\nWe have served as the Company’s auditor since 2001. \\n\\nTable of

Financial Statements \\n\\nNote 1. Summary of Significant Accounting Policies \\n\\nDescription of Business: \\n\\nMondelēz International, Inc. was incorporated in 2000 in the Commonwealth of Virginia. Mondelēz International, Inc., through its subsidiaries (collectively “Mondelēz International,” “we,” “us” and “our”), sells food and beverage products to consumers in over 150 countries. \\n\\nPrinciples of Consolidation: \\n\\nThe consolidated financial statements include Mondelēz International, Inc. as well as our wholly owned and majority owned subsidiaries, except our Venezuelan subsidiaries that were deconsolidated in 2015. All intercompany transactions are eliminated. The noncontrolling interest represents the noncontrolling investors’ interests in the results of subsidiaries that we control and consolidate. We account for investments over which we exercise significant influence under the equity method of accounting. Investments over which we do not have significant influence or control are not material and as there is no readily determinable fair value for the equity interests, these investments are carried at cost with changes in the investment recognized to the extent cash is received. \\n\\nUse of Estimates: \\n\\nWe prepare our consolidated financial statements in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America (“U.S. GAAP”), which require us to make estimates and assumptions that affect a number of amounts in our consolidated financial statements. Significant estimates include, valuation assumptions of goodwill and intangible assets, useful lives of long-lived assets, restructuring program liabilities, contingent consideration, marketing program accruals, insurance and self-insurance reserves, pension and benefit plan assumptions and income taxes. We base our estimates on historical experience, expectations of future impacts and other assumptions that we believe are reasonable. Given the uncertainty of the global economic environment, our estimates could be significantly different than future performance. If actual amounts differ from estimates, we include the updates in our consolidated results of operations in the period the actual amounts become known. \\n\\nWar in Ukraine \\n\\nIn February 2022, Russia began a military invasion of Ukraine and we closed our operations and facilities in Ukraine. In March 2022, our two Ukrainian manufacturing facilities in Trostyanets and Vyshhorod were significantly damaged. During the first quarter of 2022, we evaluated and impaired these and other related assets. We recorded $ 143 million of total expenses ($ 145 million after-tax) incurred as a direct result of the war, including $ 75 million recorded in asset impairment and exit costs , $ 44 million in cost of sales and $ 24 million in selling, general and administrative expenses. We recorded $ 75 million of property, plant and equipment impairments, $ 33 million of estimated inventory write-offs, $ 19 million of increased estimated allowances for trade receivables and $ 16 million in accrued expenses. During the remainder of 2022, we reversed approximately $ 22 million of previously recorded charges primarily as a result of higher than expected collection of trade receivables and inventory recoveries. We continue to consolidate both our Ukrainian and Russian subsidiaries and continue to evaluate our ability to control our operating activities and businesses on an ongoing basis. In connection with these findings and impacts, we have made estimates and assumptions based on information available to us. We base our estimates on historical experience, expectations of future impacts and other assumptions that we believe are reasonable. Given the uncertainty of the ongoing effects of the war in Ukraine, and its impact on the global economic environment, our estimates could be significantly different than future performance. \\n\\nCurrency Translation and Highly Inflationary Accounting : \\n\\nWe translate the results of operations of our subsidiaries from multiple currencies using average exchange rates during each period and translate balance sheet accounts using exchange rates at the end of each period. We record currency translation adjustments as a component of equity (except for highly inflationary currencies) and realized exchange gains and losses on transactions in earnings. \\n\\nHighly inflationary accounting is triggered when a country’s three-year cumulative inflation rate exceeds 100%. It requires the remeasurement of financial statements of subsidiaries in the country, from the functional currency of the subsidiary to our U.S. dollar reporting currency, with currency remeasurement gains or losses recorded in earnings. At this time, within our consolidated entities, Argentina and Türkiye are accounted for as highly inflationary economies. Argentina and Türkiye represent 1.6 % and 0.7 % of our consolidated net revenues, with remeasurement losses of $ 39 million and $ 1 million in 2022, respectively. \\n\\nTable of Contents \\n\\nCash, Cash Equivalents and Restricted Cash: \\n\\nCash and cash equivalents include demand deposits with banks and all highly liquid investments with original maturities of three months or less. We also had restricted cash within other current assets of $ 25 million as of December 31, 2022 and $ 7 million as of December 31, 2021. Total cash, cash equivalents and restricted cash was $ 1,948 million as of December 31, 2022 and $ 3,553 million as of December 31, 2021. \\n\\nAllowances for Credit Losses: \\n\\nAllowances for credit losses are recorded against our receivables. They are developed at a country and region level based on historical collection experiences, current economic condition of specific customers and the forecasted economic condition of countries using various factors such as bond default rates and consumption indexes. We write off receivables once it is determined that the receivables are no longer collectible and as allowed by local laws. \\n\\nChanges in allowances for credit losses consisted of: \\n\\n Allowance for Trade Receivables Allowance for Other Current Receivables Allowance for Long-Term Receivables \\xa0 (in millions) Balance at January 1, 2021 $ ( 42 ) $ ( 42 ) $ ( 12 ) Current period provision for expected credit losses ( 3 ) ( 13 ) — \\xa0 Write-offs charged against the allowance 5 \\xa0 3 \\xa0 2 \\xa0 Currency 3 \\xa0 3 \\xa0 — \\xa0 Balance at December 31, 2021 $ ( 37 ) $ ( 49 ) $ ( 10 ) Current period provision for expected credit losses ( 13 ) ( 14 ) ( 3 ) Write-offs charged against the allowance 2 \\xa0 3 \\xa0 — \\xa0 Currency 3 \\xa0 1 \\xa0 ( 1 ) Balance at December 31, 2022 $ ( 45 ) $ ( 59 ) $ ( 14 ) \\n\\nTransfers of Financial Assets: \\n\\nWe account for transfers of financial assets, such as uncommitted revolving non-recourse accounts receivable factoring arrangements, when we have surrendered control over the related assets. We use receivable factoring arrangements periodically when circumstances are favorable to manage liquidity. We have nonrecourse factoring arrangements in which we sell eligible trade receivables primarily to banks in exchange for cash. We may continue to collect the receivables sold, acting solely as a collecting agent on behalf of the banks. The outstanding principal amount of receivables under these arrangements amounted to $ 516 million as of December 31, 2022, $ 761 million as of December 31, 2021 and $ 760 million as of December 31, 2020. The incremental costs of factoring receivables under these arrangements were not material for all periods presented. The proceeds from the sales of receivables are included in cash from operating activities in the consolidated statements of cash flows. \\n\\nInventories: \\n\\nWe record our inventory using the average cost method and record inventory reserves for excess and obsolete inventory. \\n\\nLong-Lived Assets: \\n\\nProperty, plant and equipment are stated at historical cost and depreciated by the straight-line method over the estimated useful lives of the assets with the expense recorded in cost of sales or selling, general and administrative expenses depending on the nature of the long-lived assets. Machinery and equipment are depreciated over periods ranging from 3 to 20 years and buildings and building improvements over periods up to 40 years. \\n\\nWe review long-lived assets, including definite-life intangible assets, for realizability on an ongoing basis. Changes in depreciation, generally accelerated depreciation, are determined and recorded when estimates of the remaining useful lives or residual values of long-term assets change. We amortize definite-life intangible assets over their estimated useful lives and evaluate them for impairment as we do other long-lived assets. We review for impairment when conditions exist that indicate the carrying amount of the assets may not be fully recoverable. In those circumstances, we perform undiscounted operating cash flow analyses for asset and liability groups at the lowest level for which cash flows are separately identifiable to determine if an impairment exists. Any impairment loss is calculated as the excess of the asset’s carrying value over its estimated fair value. Fair value is estimated based on \\n\\nTable of Contents \\n\\nthe discounted cash flows for the asset group over the remaining useful life or based on the expected cash proceeds for the asset less costs of disposal. \\n\\nLeases: \\n\\nWe determine whether a contract is or contains a lease at contract inception. For short-term operating leases with terms of 12 months or less, we do not recognize right-of-use (“ROU”) assets and lease liabilities. ROU assets are recognized at commencement date at the value of the lease liability, adjusted for any prepayments, lease incentives received and initial direct costs incurred. Lease liabilities are recognized at commencement date based on the present value of remaining lease payments over the lease term. The non-recurring fair value measurement is classified as Level 3 as no fair value inputs are observable. As the implicit interest rate in the lease is not readily determinable, we use our country-specific incremental borrowing rate to discount the lease liabilities. \\n\\nOur leases may include options to extend or terminate the lease, which are included in the lease term when it is reasonably certain that we will exercise that option. Our lease agreements do not contain any material residual value guarantees or material restrictive covenants. Many of our leases contain non-lease components (e.g. product costs, common-area or other maintenance costs) that relate to the lease components of the agreement. We account for lease and non-lease components as a single lease component. \\n\\nAmortization of ROU lease assets is calculated over the lease term with the expense recorded in cost of sales or selling, general and administrative expenses depending on the nature of the leased item. Interest expense is recorded over the lease term and is recorded in interest expense (based on a front-loaded interest expense pattern) for finance leases and is recorded in cost of sales or selling, general and administrative expenses for operating leases. Variable lease payments, which are primarily comprised of product costs, insurance and tax payments based on usage or output, are recognized when the expense is incurred. Finance lease ROU assets are presented in property, plant and equipment and the related finance lease liabilities are presented in the current portion of long-term debt and long-term debt. \\n\\nSoftware Costs: \\n\\nWe capitalize certain computer software and software development costs incurred in connection with developing or obtaining computer software for internal use. Capitalized software costs are included in property, plant and equipment and amortized on a straight-line basis over the estimated useful lives of the software, which do not exceed seven years . \\n\\nGoodwill and Indefinite-Life Intangible Assets: \\n\\nWe test goodwill and indefinite-life intangible assets for impairment on an annual basis on July 1. We assess goodwill impairment risk throughout the year by performing a qualitative review of entity-specific, industry, market and general economic factors affecting our goodwill reporting units. Annually, we may perform qualitative testing, or depending on factors such as prior-year test results, current year developments, current risk evaluations and other practical considerations, we may elect to do quantitative testing instead. In our quantitative testing, we compare a reporting unit’s estimated fair value with its carrying value. We estimate a reporting unit’s fair value using a discounted cash flow method that incorporates planned growth rates, market-based discount rates and estimates of residual value. If the carrying value of a reporting unit’s net assets exceeds its fair value, we would recognize an impairment charge for the amount by which the carrying value exceeds the reporting unit’s fair value. \\n\\nAnnually, we assess indefinite-life intangible assets for impairment by performing a qualitative review and assessing events and circumstances that could affect the fair value or carrying value of these intangible assets. If significant potential impairment risk exists for a specific asset, we quantitatively test it for impairment by comparing its estimated fair value with its carrying value. During our annual testing, we use several accepted valuation methods, including Relief from Royalty, excess earnings and excess margin, that utilize estimates of future sales, earnings growth rates, royalty rates and discount rates in determining a brand’s global fair value. If the carrying value of the asset exceeds its fair value, we consider the asset impaired and reduce its carrying value to the estimated fair value. \\n\\nHeld for Sale: \\n\\nAssets and liabilities to be disposed of by sale (\"disposal groups\") are reclassified into assets and liabilities held for sale on our consolidated balance sheets. The reclassification occurs when all the held for sale criteria have been met, including when management having the requisite authority have committed to a plan to sell the assets within one year. Disposal groups are measured at the lower of carrying value or fair value less costs to sell and are not depreciated or amortized. The fair value of a disposal group, less any costs to sell, is assessed each reporting \\n\\nTable of Contents \\n\\nperiod it remains classified as held for sale and any remeasurement to the lower of carrying value or fair value less costs to sell is reported as an adjustment to the carrying value. \\n\\nBusiness Combinations: ', 'The assets acquired and liabilities assumed upon the acquisition or consolidation of a business are recorded at fair value, with the residual of the purchase price allocated to goodwill. During the measurement period, which may be up to one year from the acquisition date, we may record adjustments to assets acquired and liabilities assumed with the corresponding offset to goodwill. The results of operations of an acquired business are included in our operating results from the date of acquisition. ', 'Further, certain of our acquisitions may include earn-out provisions or other forms of contingent consideration. As of the acquisition date, we record contingent consideration, as applicable, at the estimated fair value of expected future payments associated with the earn-out. Any changes to the recorded fair value of contingent consideration will be recognized as expenses or earnings in the period in which they occur. ', 'Legal costs, due diligence costs, business valuation costs and all other business acquisition costs are expensed when incurred. ', \"Equity Method Investments: \\n\\nEquity method investments consist of our investments in entities in which we maintain an equity ownership interest and apply the equity method of accounting due to our ability to exert significant influence over decisions relating to their operating and financial affairs. Revenue and expenses of our equity method investees are not consolidated into our financial statements; rather, our proportionate share of the earnings of each investee is reflected as equity method investment net earnings. The carrying values of our equity method investments are also impacted by our proportionate share of items impacting the investee's accumulated other comprehensive income or losses and other items, such as our share of investee dividends. \\n\\nInsurance and Self-Insurance: \\n\\nWe use a combination of insurance and self-insurance for a number of risks, including workers’ compensation, general liability, automobile liability, product liability and our obligation for employee healthcare benefits. We estimate the liabilities associated with these risks on an undiscounted basis by evaluating and making judgments about historical claims experience and other actuarial assumptions and the estimated impact on future results. \\n\\nRevenue Recognition: \\n\\nWe recognize revenue when control over the products transfers to our customers, which generally occurs upon delivery or shipment of the products. We account for product shipping, handling and insurance as fulfillment activities with revenues for these activities recorded within net revenue and costs recorded within cost of sales. Any taxes collected on behalf of government authorities are excluded from net revenues. \\n\\nRevenues are recorded net of trade and sales incentives and estimated product returns. Known or expected pricing or revenue adjustments, such as trade discounts, rebates or returns, are estimated at the time of sale. We base these estimates of expected amounts principally on historical utilization and redemption rates. Estimates that affect revenue, such as trade incentives and product returns, are monitored and adjusted each period until the incentives or product returns are realized. \\n\\nKey sales terms, such as pricing and quantities ordered, are established on a frequent basis such that most customer arrangements and related incentives have a one year or shorter duration. As such, we do not capitalize contract inception costs and we capitalize product fulfillment costs. Deferred revenues are not material and primarily include customer advance payments typically collected a few days before product delivery, at which time deferred revenues are reclassified and recorded as net revenues. We generally do not receive non-cash consideration for the sale of goods nor do we grant payment financing terms greater than one year. \\n\\nMarketing, Advertising and Research and Development: \\n\\nWe promote our products with marketing and advertising programs. These programs include, but are not limited to, cooperative advertising, in-store displays and consumer marketing promotions. For interim reporting purposes, advertising, consumer promotion and marketing research expenses are charged to operations as a percentage of volume, based on estimated sales volume and estimated program spending. We do not defer costs on our year-end consolidated balance sheets and all marketing and advertising costs are recorded as an expense in the year incurred. Advertising expense was $ 1,670 million in 2022, $ 1,564 million in 2021 and $ 1,376 million in 2020. We \\n\\nTable of Contents \\n\\nexpense product research and development costs as incurred. Research and development expense was $ 346 million in 2022, $ 347 million in 2021 and $ 332 million in 2020. We record marketing and advertising as well as research and development expenses within selling, general and administrative expenses. \\n\\nStock-based Compensation: \\n\\nWe maintain a share-based compensation plan, which authorizes the granting of various equity-based incentives, including stock options (including stock appreciation rights), deferred stock units (DSUs) and performance share units (PSUs). Stock compensation expense is amortized to expense over the vesting period, generally three years . \\n\\nStock options are granted with an exercise price equal to the closing market price of our Common Stock on the grant date. Substantially all of the options become exercisable in three annual installments beginning a year from the grant date and generally expire 10 years from the grant date. We use the Black-Scholes Model to measure the fair value of stock options granted to employees. The expected life of the options represents the period of time the options are expected to be outstanding and is based on historical trends. Expected stock price volatility is based on the implied and historical volatility of the Company’s stock. The expected dividend yield is based on the Company’s most recent annual dividend rate. The risk-free interest rate is based on the U.S. Treasury yield curve in effect at the time of grant with a term equal to the expected life. \\n\\nDSUs are typically granted to selected management employees on an annual basis and vest over three years . Dividend equivalents are paid during the vesting period. The fair value of our DSUs and other stock-based awards is measured at the market price of our Common Stock on the grant date. \\n\\nPSUs vest based on varying performance, market and service conditions. Dividend equivalents accumulated over the vesting period are paid after vesting. The grant date fair value of PSUs is determined based on the Monte Carlo simulation model for the market-based component and the market price of our Common Stock on the grant date for performance-based components. The final award may equal 0 - 200 percent of the target grant, based on the achievement of the performance and market-based components . \\n\\nForfeitures are estimated on the grant date for all of our stock-based compensation awards. \\n\\nEmployee Benefit Plans: \\n\\nWe provide a range of benefits to our current and retired employees including pension benefits, defined contribution plan benefits, postretirement health care benefits and postemployment primarily severance-related benefits depending upon local statutory requirements, employee tenure and service requirements as well as other factors. The cost for these plans is recognized in earnings primarily over the working life of the covered employee. \\n\\nFinancial Instruments: \\n\\nWe use financial instruments to manage our currency exchange rate, commodity price and interest rate risks. We monitor and manage these exposures as part of our overall risk management program, which focuses on the unpredictability of financial markets and seeks to reduce the potentially adverse effects that the volatility of these markets may have on our operating results. A principal objective of our risk management strategies is to reduce significant, unanticipated earnings fluctuations that may arise from volatility in currency exchange rates, commodity prices and interest rates. \\n\\nWhen we use derivatives, we are exposed to credit and market risks. We reduce our credit risk by entering into transactions with counterparties with high quality, investment grade credit ratings, limiting the amount of exposure with each counterparty and monitoring the financial condition of our counterparties. We also maintain a policy of requiring that all significant, non-exchange traded derivative contracts with a duration of one year or longer are governed by an International Swaps and Derivatives Association master agreement. We manage derivative market risk by limiting the types of derivative instruments, derivative strategies we use, and the degree of market risk that we plan to hedge through the use of derivative instruments. \\n\\nWe record derivative financial instruments on a gross basis in our consolidated balance sheets. The fair value of our instruments are recorded within other current assets, other assets, other current liabilities, and other liabilities in our consolidated balance sheets. \\n\\nMark-to-market gains or losses related to our economic hedges are classified in the consolidated statements of cash flows in other non-cash items, net, within operating activities. Cash flows related to the settlement of derivative instruments designated as hedges of net investments in non-U.S. operations are classified in the consolidated \\n\\nTable of Contents \\n\\nstatements of cash flows within investing activities. Cash flows related to derivative instruments that are designated or settled economic hedges are classified in the same line item as the cash flows of the related hedged item. Cash flows related to the settlement of all other free-standing derivative instruments are classified within investing activities. \\n\\nCommodity derivatives . We are exposed to price risk related to forecasted purchases of certain commodities that we primarily use as raw materials. We enter into commodity forward, futures and option contracts. Commodity forward contracts generally are not subject to the accounting requirements for derivative instruments and hedging activities under the normal purchases exception. We sell commodity futures to hedge future purchase commitments. We occasionally use related futures to cross-hedge a commodity exposure. We are not a party to leveraged derivatives and, by policy, do not use financial instruments for speculative purposes. Any mark-to-market gains or losses are recorded in earnings (see Note 10, Financial Instruments , for additional information). \\n\\nCurrency exchange derivatives . We enter into currency exchange forward contracts, futures, options and swaps.to mitigate our exposure to changes in exchange rates from third-party and intercompany current and forecasted transactions. Any mark-to-market gains or losses are recorded in earnings (see Note 10, Financial Instruments , for additional information). \\n\\nInterest rate cash flow hedges . We manage interest rate volatility by modifying the pricing or maturity characteristics of certain liabilities so that the net impact on expense is not, on a material basis, adversely affected by movements in interest rates. We use derivative instruments, including interest rate swaps that have indices related to the pricing of specific liabilities as part of our interest rate risk management strategy. We use cross-currency interest rate swaps to hedge interest payments on newly issued debt denominated in a different currency than the functional currency of the borrowing entity. Substantially all of these derivative instruments are highly effective and qualify for hedge accounting treatment. Changes in the fair value of derivatives that are designated as a cash flow hedge, to the extent the hedge is effective, are recorded in accumulated other comprehensive earnings/(losses), net of deferred taxes, and reclassified to earnings when the hedged item affects earnings (see Note 10, Financial Instruments , for additional information). \\n\\nHedges of net investments in non-U.S. operations . We have numerous investments outside the United States. The net assets of these subsidiaries are exposed to changes and volatility in currency exchange rates. We use local currency denominated debt to hedge our non-U.S. net investments against adverse movements in exchange rates. We may designate non-U.S. dollar-denominated borrowings in the U.S. as a net investment hedge of a portion of our overall non-U.S. operations. The gains and losses on our net investment in these designated non-U.S. operations are economically offset by losses and gains designated dollar-denominated borrowings. The revaluation of designated borrowings, net of deferred taxes, is recorded within currency translation adjustment in accumulated other comprehensive earnings/(losses) (see Note 10, Financial Instruments , for additional information). \\n\\nWe use derivatives instruments to hedge certain investments in our non-U.S. operations against movements in exchange rates. These instruments may include cross-currency interest rate swaps, forwards and options. The after-tax gain/(loss) on these net investment hedge contracts, net of deferred taxes, is recorded within cumulative translation adjustment in accumulated other comprehensive earnings/(losses) (see Note 10, Financial Instruments , for additional information). \\n\\nIncome Taxes: \\n\\nOur provision for income taxes includes amounts payable or refundable for the current year, the effects of deferred taxes and impacts from uncertain tax positions. We recognize deferred tax assets and liabilities for the expected future tax consequences of temporary differences between the financial statement and tax basis of our assets and liabilities, operating loss carryforwards and tax credit carryforwards. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured using enacted tax rates expected to apply in the years in which those differences are expected to reverse. \\n\\nThe realization of certain deferred tax assets is dependent on generating sufficient taxable income in the appropriate jurisdiction prior to the expiration of the carryforward periods. Deferred tax assets are reduced by a valuation allowance if it is more likely than not that some portion, or all, of the deferred tax assets will not be realized. When assessing the need for a valuation allowance, we consider any carryback potential, future reversals of existing taxable temporary differences (including liabilities for unrecognized tax benefits), future taxable income and tax planning strategies. \\n\\nTable of Contents \\n\\nWe recognize tax benefits in our financial statements from uncertain tax positions only if it is more likely than not that the tax position will be sustained based on the technical merits of the position. The amount we recognize is measured as the largest amount of benefit that is greater than 50 percent likely of being realized upon resolution. Future changes related to the expected resolution of uncertain tax positions could affect tax expense in the period when the change occurs. \\n\\nWe monitor for changes in tax laws and reflect the impacts of tax law changes in the period of enactment. When there is refinement to tax law changes in subsequent periods, we account for the new guidance in the period when it becomes known. \\n\\nNew Accounting Pronouncements: \\n\\nIn October 2021, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (“FASB”) issued an Accounting Standards Update (“ASU”) which requires companies to recognize and measure customer contract assets and contract liabilities acquired in a business combination as if the acquiring company originated the related revenue contracts. Prior to adopting this ASU, acquired contract assets and liabilities were measured at fair value. This ASU is effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2022 and early adoption is permitted. We are evaluating the timing and effects of adopting this ASU and currently we do not expect this ASU to have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements. \\n\\nIn March 2020 and subsequently in January 2021 and December 2022, the FASB issued ASUs to provide optional accounting guidance for a limited period of time to ease the potential burden in accounting for reference rate reform. The guidance provides optional expedients and exceptions to existing accounting requirements for contract modifications and hedge accounting related to transitioning from discontinued reference rates, such as LIBOR, to alternative reference rates, if certain criteria are met. The new accounting requirements can be applied as of the beginning of the interim period including March 12, 2020, or any date thereafter, through December 31, 2024. We adopted this standard in the fourth quarter of 2022 and it did not have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements. \\n\\nIn September 2022, the FASB issued an ASU which enhances the transparency of supplier finance programs by requiring additional disclosure about the key terms of these programs and a roll-forward of the related obligations to understand the effects of these programs on working capital, liquidity and cash flows. The ASU is effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2022, except for the roll-forward requirement, which is effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2023. Early adoption is permitted. We are currently assessing the impact on our consolidated financial statements and related disclosures. \\n\\nTable of Contents \\n\\nNote 2. Acquisitions and Divestitures \\n\\nAcquisitions \", \"Ricolino On November 1, 2022, we acquired 100 % of the equity of Grupo Bimbo's confectionery business, Ricolino, located primarily in Mexico.

The fair value for the Ricolino, Dulces Vero, LaCorona and Coronado trade names were determined using the Relief from Royalty method, a form of the income approach, at the acquisition date. The fair value measurement of indefinite-life intangible assets are based on significant unobservable inputs, and thus represent Leve l 3 inputs. Significant assumptions used in assessing the fair values of intangible assets include estimates of future sales, discount and royalty rates. ', 'Goodwill was determined as the excess of the purchase price over the fair value of the net assets acquired and arises principally as a result of expansion opportunities and synergies across both new and legacy product categories in Mexico. None of the goodwill recognized is expected to be deductible for income tax purposes. All of the goodwill was assigned to the Latin American operating segment. ', 'Ricolino added incremental net revenues of $ 105 million and operating income of $ 1 million in 2022. In 2022, we recorded several items within acquisition-related costs that resulted in income of $ 64 million as realized gains related to hedging contracts associated with acquisition funds more than offset other acquisition transaction costs. We incurred acquisition integration costs of $ 11 million and an inventory step-up charge of $ 5 million in 2022. ', 'Table of Contents \\n\\nClif Bar ', 'On August 1, 2022, we acquired 100 % of the equity of Clif Bar & Company (“Clif Bar”), a leading U.S. maker of nutritious energy bars with organic ingredients. The acquisition expands our global snack bar business and complements our refrigerated snacking and performance nutrition bar portfolios. The total cash payment of $ 2.9 billion includes purchase price consideration of $ 2.6 billion, net of cash received, and one-time compensation expense of $ 0.3 billion related to the buyout of the non-vested employee stock ownership plan (\"ESOP\") shares. This compensation expense is considered an acquisition-related cost. The acquisition of Clif Bar includes a contingent consideration arrangement that may require us to pay additional consideration to the sellers for achieving certain revenue and earnings targets in 2025 and 2026 that exceed our base financial projections for the business implied in the upfront purchase price. The possible payments range from zero to a maximum total of $ 2.4 billion, with higher payouts requiring the achievement of targets that generate rates of returns in excess of the base financial projections. The estimated fair value of the contingent consideration obligation at the acquisition date was $ 440 million determined using a Monte Carlo simulation. Significant assumptions used in assessing the fair value of the liability include financial projections for net revenue, gross profit, and earnings before interest, tax, depreciation and amortization (\"EBITDA\"), as well as discount and volatility rates.

In addition, we depend on information technology for digital marketing and electronic communications between our facilities, personnel, customers and suppliers, including ordering and managing raw materials and inputs, receiving and processing purchase orders, shipping products to customers and processing other transactions. Communications between our facilities, personnel, customers and suppliers may include and is not limited to personal confidential information and payment card industry data, confidential and propriety intellectual property, trade secrets and other information and business and financial information. Like other companies, our information technology systems may be vulnerable to a variety of disruptions, including but not limited to the process of upgrading or replacing software, databases or components thereof, user errors, natural disasters, terrorist attacks, telecommunications failures, computer viruses, cyber attacks, hackers, unauthorized access attempts and other security issues. In addition, such incidents could result in unauthorized or accidental disclosure of material confidential information or regulated individual personal data.

Any such downtime could have significant impacts on our ability to continue our business operations, including our ability to operate our facilities, manage and track inventory, manage and track incoming new orders and statuses of existing orders, and to continue to comply with regulatory, legal and tax requirements. In the event any significant failure of our systems requires us to upgrade or set up new systems, oversight and implementation of the new system and training personnel could be costly, there may be further disruptions from potential instability in the new system, and there may be heightened cybersecurity risks in connection with the migration of data to the new system. In addition, we may suffer financial and reputational damage or penalties because of the unauthorized disclosure of confidential information belonging to us or to our business partners, customers, consumers or suppliers. Finally, the disclosure of non-public information through external media channels could lead to the loss of intellectual property or damage our reputation and brand image. Similar risks exist with respect to the third-party vendors that we rely upon for aspects of our information technology support services and administrative functions, including health and benefit plan administration and certain finance and accounting functions, and systems managed, hosted, provided and/or used by third parties and their vendors. We have not experienced any significant cyber-related events in the current fiscal year. ', 'We are subject to a variety of legal and regulatory restrictions on how and to whom we market our products, for instance marketing to children, which may limit our ability to maintain or extend our brand image. If we do not maintain or extend our brand image, then our product sales, financial condition and results of operations could be materially and adversely affected. ', 'Our products may be subject to contamination by foreign materials or disease-producing organisms or pathogens, such as Listeria monocytogenes, Salmonella and E. coli. These organisms and pathogens are found generally in the environment and there is a risk that one or more, as a result of food processing, could be present in our products. These organisms and pathogens also can be introduced to our products as a result of improper handling at the further-processing, foodservice or consumer level. These risks may be controlled, but may not be eliminated, by adherence to good manufacturing practices and finished product testing. We have little, if any, control over handling procedures once our products have been shipped for distribution. Even an inadvertent shipment of contaminated products may be a violation of law and may lead to increased risk of exposure to product liability claims, increased scrutiny and penalties, including injunctive relief and plant closings, by federal and state regulatory agencies, and adverse publicity, which could exacerbate the associated negative consumer reaction. Some of our commercial contracts with our customers have uncapped indemnification clauses or no limitation of liability provisions, so any of these occurrences could cause us to pay significant amounts in penalties and spend significant resources, which could have a material adverse effect on our financial results. While we also benefit from certain indemnification obligations from our customers, such protections may not adequately cover all claims brought against us or cover only a portion of such claim. In addition, we may be required to recall some of our products if they spoil, become contaminated, are tampered with or are mislabeled. A widespread product recall could result in significant losses due to the costs of a recall, the destruction of product inventory and lost sales due to the unavailability of product for a period of time. Such a product recall also could result in adverse publicity, damage to our reputation, and a loss of consumer confidence in our products, which could have a material adverse effect on our business results and the value of our brands. ', 'Our operations are subject to extensive federal, state and foreign laws and regulations by authorities that oversee food safety standards and processing, packaging, storage, distribution, advertising, labeling and export of our products. See &#8220;Environmental Regulation and Food Safety&#8221; in Item 1 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K for more information. Changes in laws or regulations that impose additional regulatory requirements on us (including the United Kingdom&#8217;s exit from the European Union) could increase our cost of doing business or restrict our actions, causing our results of operations to be adversely affected. For example, increased governmental interest in advertising practices may result in regulations that could require us to change or restrict our advertising practices. Additionally, new laws in the European Union requiring traceability of commodities from source of origin and verification that commodities are deforestation free could impact commodity sourcing, pricing and our ability to place products in certain markets. ', 'Climate change and any legal or regulatory responses may have a long-term adverse impact on our business and results of operations. ', 'Increasing concern over climate change also may adversely impact demand for our products due to changes in consumer preferences and result in additional legal or regulatory requirements designed to manage greenhouse gas emissions, climate risks, and resulting environmental impacts. Increased energy or compliance costs and expenses due to increased legal or regulatory requirements could be prohibitively costly and may cause disruptions in, or an increase in the costs associated with, the running of our production facilities. Furthermore, compliance with any such legal or regulatory requirements may require us to make significant changes to our business operations and strategy, which will likely incur substantial time, attention and costs. Even if we make changes to align ourselves with such legal or regulatory requirements, we may still be subject to significant fines if such laws and regulations are interpreted and applied in a manner inconsistent with our practices. The effects of climate change and legal or regulatory initiatives to address climate change could have a long-term adverse impact on our business and results of operations. ', 'Legal claims, class action lawsuits, other regulatory enforcement actions, or failure to comply with applicable legal standards or requirements could affect our product sales, reputation and profitability.

      "acquisitions: ['We account for acquired businesses using the acquisition method of accounting, which requires that once control of a business is obtained, 100% of the assets acquired and liabilities assumed, including amounts attributable to noncontrolling interests, be recorded at the date of acquisition at their respective fair values. Any excess of the purchase price over the estimated fair values of the net assets acquired is recorded as goodwill. Acquisition-related expenses including transaction and integration costs are expensed as incurred. ', 'We use various models to determine the value of assets acquired such as net realizable value to value inventory, cost method and market approach to value property, relief-from-royalty and multi-period excess earnings to value intangibles, and discounted cash flow to value goodwill. We make estimates and assumptions about projected future cash flows including sales growth, operating margins, attrition rates, and discount rates based on historical results, business plans, expected synergies, perceived risk, and marketplace data considering the perspective of marketplace participants. Determining the useful life of an intangible asset also requires judgment as different types of intangible assets will have different useful lives and certain assets may be considered to have indefinite useful lives. Government Assistance Programs ', 'We periodically receive government assistance typically in the form of cash grants or refundable tax credits (collectively “Grant” or “Grants”). The Grants generally specify conditions that must be met in order for the Grants to be earned, such as employment, employee retention targets, and construction or acquisition of property and equipment and are often time-bound. If conditions are not satisfied or if the duration period for the arrangement is not met, the Grants may be subject to reduction, repayment, or termination. ', 'During fiscal years 2023, 2022, and 2021, we received amounts related to Grants that were not material to the financial statements; however, this conclusion can change based on additional grants received in the future. To the extent amounts have been received by the Company in advance of completion of the conditions, they have been recognized in other current liabilities or other liabilities in the Consolidated Balance Sheets, as appropriate. Use of Estimates The consolidated financial statements are prepared in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States, which require us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the amounts reported in the consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes. Actual results could differ from those estimates. During fiscal 2023, we revised estimates and recorded adjustments of approximately $30 million primarily to reduce certain employee compensation accruals recorded as of October 1, 2022. Recently Issued Accounting Pronouncements In March 2023, the FASB issued authoritative guidance intended to address issues related to arrangements between entities under common control such as terms and conditions an entity should consider for determining whether a lease exists and the classification and accounting for that lease as well as accounting for leasehold improvements associated with leases between entities under common control. The guidance is effective for annual reporting periods and interim periods within those annual reporting periods beginning after December 15, 2023, our fiscal 2025 and can be applied using either the prospective or retrospective approach. We are currently evaluating the impact this guidance will have on our consolidated financial statements. In March 2020, the FASB issued guidance providing optional expedients and exceptions to account for the effects of reference rate reform to contracts, hedging relationships, and other transactions that reference LIBOR or another reference rate expected to be discontinued. The optional guidance, which became effective on March 12, 2020 and was set to end on December 31, 2022, was extended by new guidance issued by the FASB on December 21, 2022 to apply through December 31, 2024. The temporary accounting relief provided in the optional guidance has not impacted our consolidated financial statements. The Company has various contracts that reference LIBOR and is assessing how this standard may be applied to specific contract modifications through December 31, 2024. NOTE 2: CHANGES IN ACCOUNTING PRINCIPLES In September 2022, the FASB issued guidance that requires additional disclosures for supplier finance programs to allow users to better understand the nature, activity and potential magnitude of the programs. The guidance, except for a requirement for rollforward information, is effective for annual reporting periods and interim periods within those annual reporting periods beginning after December 15, 2022, our fiscal 2024. Disclosure of rollforward information is effective for fiscal years after December 15, 2023, our fiscal 2025. Early adoption is permitted and the retrospective transition method should be applied for all amendments except rollforward information, which should be applied prospectively. We elected to early adopt the initial disclosure requirement for the fiscal year ended September 30, 2023, and it did not have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements. In November 2021, the FASB issued authoritative guidance intended to provide consistent and transparent disclosures around government assistance by requiring disclosures of the type of government assistance, our method of accounting for the government assistance and the effect on our financial statements. This guidance is effective for annual reporting periods beginning after December 15, 2021, our fiscal 2023 and can be applied using either the prospective or retrospective approach. We adopted this guidance for the fiscal year ended September 30, 2023, and it did not have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements as amounts received from government assistance programs were not material. NOTE 3: ACQUISITIONS AND DISPOSITIONS Acquisitions ', 'In the third quarter of fiscal 2023, we acquired Williams Sausage Company for $ 223 million, net of cash acquired, subject to certain adjustments, as part of our growth strategy to increase our capacity and product portfolio. Its results, subsequent to the acquisition closing, are included in the Prepared Foods segment and through September 30, 2023, were insignificant to our Consolidated Statements of Income. Certain estimated values for the acquisition, including goodwill, intangible assets, property, plant and equipment, other liabilities, and deferred taxes are not yet finalized and are subject to adjustment as additional information becomes available and more detailed analyses are completed. The preliminary purchase price allocation includes $ 2 million of net working capital, including $ 3 million of cash acquired, $ 67 million of Property, Plant and Equipment, $ 120 million of Goodwill, $ 65 million of Intangible Assets, and $ 28 million of Deferred Income Taxes. Intangible Assets include brands and trademarks and customer relationships which will be amortized over a life of 20 and 12 years, respectively. $ 46 million of the goodwill is deductible for U.S. income tax purposes. The acquisition of Williams Sausage Company was accounted for using the acquisition method of accounting. ', 'In the first quarter of fiscal 2023, we completed the acquisition of a 60 % equity stake in Supreme Foods Processing Company (\"SFPC\"), a producer and distributor of value-added and cooked chicken and beef products, and a 15 % equity stake in Agricultural Development Company (\"ADC\"), a fully integrated poultry company, for a total purchase price of $ 75 million, net of cash acquired. Both SFPC and ADC were subsidiaries of Tanmiah Food Company. The results of SFPC, subsequent to the acquisition closing, are included in International/Other for segment presentation and through September 30, 2023 were insignificant to our Consolidated Statements of Income. We are accounting for the investment in ADC under the equity method. Acquisition of equity method investments in fiscal 2023, which totaled $115 million, primarily included ADC and the purchase of a minority interest in a global insect-based ingredients company as well as deferred payments related to a prior year investment. In the fourth quarter of fiscal 2022, we acquired a 35 % minority interest in a South American-based fully integrated poultry company for approximately $ 100 million. We are accounting for the investment under the equity method. In the third quarter of fiscal 2021, we acquired a 49 % minority interest in a Malaysian producer of feed and poultry products for $ 44 million in addition to future contingent payments of up to approximately $ 65 million of which $ 27 million was recognized in fiscal 2023. We are accounting for the investment under the equity method. Dispositions We completed the sale of our pet treats business, which was included in our Prepared Foods segment, in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2021 for $ 1.2 billion, subject to certain adjustments. As a result of the sale, we recorded a pretax gain of $ 784 million , or post tax gain of $ 510 million, which was reflected in Cost of Sales in our Consolidated Statement of Income for our fiscal 2021. The business had a net carrying value of $ 411 million which included $ 44 million of working capital consisting of inventory, accounts receivable and accounts payable, $ 17 million of property, plant and equipment and $ 350 million of goodwill. The goodwill was not deductible for tax purposes. The Company concluded the business was not a significant disposal and did not represent a strategic shift, and therefore was not classified as a discontinued operation for any of the periods presented .

NOTE 6: LEASES We lease certain equipment, buildings and land related to transportation, distribution, storage, production, livestock grower assets and office activities. These lease arrangements can be structured as a standard lease agreement or embedded in a service or supply agreement and are primarily classified as operating leases. For further description of our lease accounting policy, refer to Note 1: Business and Summary of Significant Accounting Policies.

NOTE 7: RESTRUCTURING AND RELATED CHARGES 2022 Program The Company approved a restructuring program in fiscal 2022 (the “2022 Program”), to improve business performance, increase collaboration, enhance team member agility, enable faster decision-making and reduce redundancies. In conjunction with the 2022 Program, the Company relocated all its corporate team members from its former Chicago, Downers Grove and Dakota Dunes area corporate locations to its world headquarters in Springdale, Arkansas. In fiscal 2023, the Company approved an extension to the program to remove additional redundancies in corporate overhead. Additionally, during fiscal 2023, we revised the total 2022 Program anticipated expenses down $ 69 million due to revised estimates related to relocation, lease terminations, and professional and other fees, based on actual experience, which were partially offset by increased severance costs associated with the program extension. We anticipate the 2022 Program and associated expenses will be complete in our fiscal 2025. The following table reflects the total pretax anticipated expenses associated with the 2022 Program (in millions):  Beef Pork Chicken Prepared Foods International/Other Total Severance costs $ 24  $ 7  $ 20  $ 52  $ 19  $ 122  Relocation and related costs 21  7  4  21  1  54  Accelerated depreciation 5  2  —  12  —  19  Contract and lease terminations —  —  —  21  —  21  Professional and other fees 2  1  —  3  2  8  Total 2022 Program $ 52  $ 17  $ 24  $ 109  $ 22  $ 224   Restructuring costs include severance expenses and related charges directly associated with the 2022 Program such as relocation, contract and lease terminations, professional fees and accelerated depreciation resulting from the closure of facilities. We anticipate that $ 50 million and $ 174 million of the total pretax anticipated expense will be recorded in Cost of Sales and Selling, General and Administrative, respectively, in our Consolidated Statements of Income. Included in the table above are $ 202 million of charges that have resulted or will result in cash outflows and $ 22 million in non-cash charges.

Included in the above results are $ 108 million of charges that have resulted or will result in cash outflows and $ 16 million in non-cash charges. The following table reflects the pretax impact of the 2022 Program’s restructuring and related charges during fiscal 2022 by reportable segment (in millions):  Beef Pork Chicken Prepared Foods International/Other Total Severance costs $ 16  $ 5  $ 6  $ 36  $ 3  $ 66  Relocation and related costs —  —  —  —  —  —  Accelerated depreciation —  —  —  —  —  —  Contract and lease terminations —  —  —  —  —  —  Professional and other fees —  —  —  —  —  —  Total $ 16  $ 5  $ 6  $ 36  $ 3  $ 66  During fiscal 2022, we recorded restructuring and related charges associated with the 2022 Program of $ 18 million and $ 48 million in Cost of Sales and Selling, General and Administrative, respectively, in our Consolidated Statements of Income. Included in the above results are $ 66 million of charges that have resulted or will result in cash outflows and no non-cash charges.

Included in the above results are $ 174 million of charges to date that have resulted or will result in cash outflows and $ 16 million in non-cash charges to date. The following table reflects our liability related to the 2022 Program, which was recognized in other current liabilities in our Consolidated Balance sheet as of September 30, 2023 (in millions):  Balance at October 1, 2022 Restructuring Expense Payments Changes in Estimates Balance at September 30, 2023 Severance costs $ 66  $ 68  $ ( 63 ) $ ( 13 ) $ 58  Relocation and related costs —  42  ( 37 ) —  5  Contract and lease termination —  5  ( 5 ) — — Professional and other fees —  6  ( 4 ) —  2  Total $ 66  $ 121  $ ( 109 ) $ ( 13 ) $ 65  As the Company continues to evaluate its business strategies and long-term growth targets, additional restructuring activities may occur. Plant Closures During fiscal 2023, as part of a strategic review of assets, the Company approved the closure of six Chicken segment processing facilities located in Glen Allen, Virginia; Van Buren, Arkansas; Corydon, Indiana; Dexter, Missouri; Noel, Missouri; and North Little Rock, Arkansas, to optimize asset utilization. We shifted production to other facilities and ceased operations at our Glen Allen and Van Buren facilities during fiscal 2023 and expect to shift production and cease operations at the remaining locations during the first half of fiscal 2024. As a result of the closures, we recorded $ 322 million of charges in fiscal 2023, primarily related to grower contract terminations, impairments, accelerated depreciation, severance, retention and related costs. Additionally, during fiscal 2023, we recorded an impairment charge of $ 17 million related to the discontinuation of a product line in the Prepared Foods segment. The charges are reflected in the Consolidated Statements of Income in Cost of Sales and included $ 201 million of charges that have resulted or will result in cash outflows and $ 138 million in non-cash charges. Our plant closure liability was $ 165 million as of September 30, 2023, and we had no plant closure liability as of October 1, 2022. We made cash payments of $ 36 million in fiscal 2023 related to the plant closures. We continue to strategically evaluate optimization of such items as network capacity, manufacturing efficiencies and business technology. If we have a significant change in strategies, outlook, or a manner in which we plan to use these assets, we may be exposed to future impairments.

Revolving Credit Facility and Letters of Credit We have a $ 2.25 billion revolving credit facility that supports short-term funding needs and serves as a backstop to our commercial paper program. The facility will mature and the commitments thereunder will terminate in September 2026 with options for two one-year extensions. At September 30, 2023, amounts available for borrowing under this facility totaled $ 2.25 billion before deducting amounts to backstop our commercial paper program. At September 30, 2023 we had no borrowings and no outstanding letters of credit issued under this facility. At September 30, 2023 we had $ 96 million of bilateral letters of credit issued separately from the revolving credit facility, none of which were drawn upon. Our letters of credit are issued primarily in support of workers’ compensation insurance programs and other legal obligations. In the future, if any of our subsidiaries shall guarantee any of our material indebtedness, such subsidiary shall be required to guarantee the indebtedness, obligations and liabilities under this facility. In November 2022, we entered into an amendment to change the reference rate from the London interbank offered rate (commonly referred to as LIBOR) to a rate based on the secured overnight financing rate (commonly referred to as SOFR). Commercial Paper Program We have a commercial paper program under which we may issue unsecured short-term promissory notes up to an aggregate maximum principal amount of $ 1.5 billion. As of September 30, 2023, we had $ 592 million of commercial paper outstanding at a weighted average interest rate of 5.48 % with maturities of less than 20 days . Our ability to access commercial paper in the future may be limited or its costs increased. Term Loan Facilities In the third quarter of fiscal 2023, we executed two new term loan facilities totaling $ 1.75 billion to refinance our short-term promissory notes (\"commercial paper program\") and for general corporate purposes. The first term loan facility totaling $ 1.0 billion matures on May 3, 2026 and we borrowed the full $ 1.0 billion available under this loan facility. The second term loan facility totaling $ 750 million matures on May 3, 2028 and at September 30, 2023, we had no outstanding borrowings under this facility. In November 2023, we borrowed the full $ 750 million available under the second term loan facility to refinance the outstanding commercial paper and for general corporate purposes. Both term loans may be prepaid under certain conditions. The interest rate on both term loan facilities will be equal to SOFR plus a predetermined borrowing spread determined by our credit rating. Additionally, the term loan facilities contain covenants that are similar to those contained in the revolving credit facility. Debt Covenants ', 'Our revolving credit facility and term loan facilities contain affirmative and negative covenants that, among other things, may limit or restrict our ability to: create liens and encumbrances; incur debt; merge, dissolve, liquidate or consolidate; make acquisitions and investments; dispose of or transfer assets; change the nature of our business; engage in certain transactions with affiliates; and enter into hedging transactions, in each case, subject to certain qualifications and exceptions. In addition, we are required to maintain a minimum interest expense coverage ratio. ', \"Our senior notes also contain affirmative and negative covenants that, among other things, may limit or restrict our ability to: create liens; engage in certain sale/leaseback transactions; and engage in certain consolidations, mergers and sales of assets. We were in compliance with all debt covenants at September 30, 2023. NOTE 9: EQUITY Capital Stock We have two classes of capital stock, Class A Common stock, $ 0.10 par value (“Class A stock”) and Class B Common Stock, $ 0.10 par value (“Class B stock”). Holders of Class B stock may convert such stock into Class A stock on a share-for-share basis. Holders of Class B stock are entitled to 10 votes per share, while holders of Class A stock are entitled to one vote per share on matters submitted to shareholders for approval. As of September 30, 2023, TLP owned 99.985 % of the outstanding shares of Class B stock and the TLP and members of the Tyson family owned, in the aggregate, 2.44 % of the outstanding shares of Class A stock, giving them, collectively, control of approximately 71.74 % of the total voting power of the outstanding voting stock. The Class B stock is considered a participating security requiring the use of the two-class method for the computation of basic earnings per share. The two-class computation method for each period reflects the cash dividends paid for each class of stock, plus the amount of allocated undistributed earnings (losses) computed using the participation percentage, which reflects the dividend rights of each class of stock. Basic earnings per share were computed using the two-class method for all periods presented. The shares of Class B stock are considered to be participating convertible securities since the shares of Class B stock are convertible on a share-for-share basis into shares of Class A stock. Diluted earnings per share, if dilutive, were computed assuming the conversion of the Class B shares into Class A shares as of the beginning of each period. Dividends Cash dividends cannot be paid to holders of Class B stock unless they are simultaneously paid to holders of Class A stock. The per share amount of the cash dividend paid to holders of Class B stock cannot exceed 90 % of the cash dividend simultaneously paid to holders of Class A stock. We pay quarterly cash dividends to Class A and Class B shareholders. We paid Class A dividends per share of $ 1.92 , $ 1.84 , and $ 1.78 in fiscal 2023, 2022, and 2021, respectively. We paid Class B dividends per share of $ 1.73 , $ 1.66 , and $ 1.60 in fiscal 2023, 2022, and 2021, respectively. Effective November 10, 2023, the Board of Directors increased the quarterly dividend previously declared on August 10, 2023, to $ 0.49 per share on our Class A stock and $ 0.441 per share on our Class B stock. The increased quarterly dividend is payable on December 15, 2023, to shareholders of record at the close of business on December 1, 2023. We had dividends payable of $ 167 million and $ 162 million at September 30, 2023 and October 1, 2022, respectively. Share Repurchases As of September 30, 2023, 7.3 million shares remained available for repurchase under the Company’s share repurchase program. The program has no fixed or scheduled termination date and the timing and extent to which we repurchase shares will depend upon, among other things, our working capital needs, markets, industry conditions, liquidity targets, limitations under our debt obligations and regulatory requirements. In addition to the share repurchase program, we purchase shares on the open market to fund certain obligations under our equity compensation plans. A summary of cumulative share repurchases of our Class A stock for fiscal years 2023, 2022 and 2021 is as follows (in millions):  September 30, 2023 October 1, 2022 October 2, 2021 Shares Dollars Shares Dollars Shares Dollars Shares repurchased: Under share repurchase program 4.7  $ 300  6.9  $ 587  —  $ —  To fund certain obligations under equity compensation plans 0.9  54  1.3  115  0.9  67  Total share repurchases 5.6  $ 354  8.2  $ 702  0.9  $ 67   NOTE 10: INCOME TAXES Detail of the provision for income taxes from continuing operations consists of the following for fiscal years 2023, 2022 and 2021 (in millions):  2023 2022 2021 Federal $ ( 39 ) $ 764  $ 791  State ( 38 ) 94  163  Foreign 48  42  27   $ ( 29 ) $ 900  $ 981  Current $ 154  $ 636  $ 1,106  Deferred ( 183 ) 264  ( 125 )  $ ( 29 ) $ 900  $ 981   The reasons for the difference between the statutory federal income tax rate and our effective income tax rate from continuing operations are as follows for fiscal years 2023, 2022 and 2021:  2023 2022 2021 Federal income tax rate 21.0  % 21.0  % 21.0  % State income taxes ( 0.7 ) 2.9  3.3  Foreign-derived intangible income deduction —  ( 1.0 ) ( 1.1 ) Deferred income tax remeasurement 3.8  ( 0.9 ) —  General business credits 3.4  ( 0.5 ) ( 0.5 ) Goodwill ( 24.2 ) —  1.8  Other 1.0  0.2  ( 0.2 ) 4.3  % 21.7  % 24.3  %  During fiscal 2023, state tax benefit, net of federal impact, was $ 21 million, which includes $ 26 million benefit related to the remeasurement of deferred income taxes, primarily due to legislation decreasing state tax rates enacted in fiscal 2023. Non-deductible goodwill impairments unfavorably impacted the effective tax rate by 24.2 %. The tax benefit from income tax credits was $ 23 million. During fiscal 2022, state tax expense, net of federal benefit, was $ 83 million, which includes $ 36 million benefit related to the remeasurement of deferred income taxes, primarily due to legislation decreasing state tax rates enacted in fiscal 2022. The tax benefit from foreign-derived intangible income deduction was $ 42 million. During fiscal 2021, state tax expense, net of federal benefit, was $ 135 million, and the tax benefit from foreign-derived intangible income deduction was $ 44 million. Non-deductible goodwill associated with the sale of our pet treats business increased the effective tax rate by 1.8 %. Approximately ($ 643 ) million, $ 4,025 million and $ 3,963 million of income (loss) from continuing operations before income taxes for fiscal 2023, 2022 and 2021, respectively, were from our operations based in the United States. We recognize deferred income taxes for the future tax consequences attributable to differences between the financial statement carrying amounts of existing assets and liabilities and their respective tax bases. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured using tax rates expected to apply to taxable income in the years in which those temporary differences are expected to be recovered or settled. The tax effects of major items recorded as deferred tax assets and liabilities as of September 30, 2023 and October 1, 2022, are as follows (in millions):  2023 2022 Assets Liabilities Assets Liabilities Property, plant and equipment $ —  $ 1,030  $ —  $ 1,091  Intangible assets —  1,495  —  1,515  ROU assets —  150  —  144  Accrued expenses 400  —  410  —  Lease liabilities 135  —  126  —  Net operating loss and other carryforwards 192  — 198  — Other 193  346  87  326  $ 920  $ 3,021  $ 821  $ 3,076  Valuation allowance $ ( 199 ) $ ( 195 ) Net deferred tax liability $ 2,300  $ 2,450   At September 30, 2023, our gross state net operating loss carryforwards approximated $ 1,710 million, of which $ 1,466 million expire in fiscal years 2024 through 2043, and the remainder has no expiration. Gross foreign net operating loss carryforwards approximated $ 302 million, of which $ 116 million expire in fiscal years 2024 through 2043, and the remainder has no expiration. We also have tax credit carryforwards of approximately $ 44 million which expire in fiscal years 2024 through 2038. We have accumulated undistributed earnings of foreign subsidiaries aggregating approximately $ 667 million at September 30, 2023. Our undistributed earnings are generally expected to be indefinitely reinvested outside of the United States, except for excess cash (net of applicable withholding taxes) not subject to regulatory requirements. Dividends after December 31, 2017 from foreign subsidiaries are generally not subject to U.S. federal income taxes. Accordingly, no deferred income taxes have been provided on these earnings, and due to the uncertainty of the manner in which the outside basis difference associated with these earnings would reverse, it is not currently practicable to estimate the tax liability that might be payable on the repatriation of these foreign earnings; however, we do not expect any tax due to be material. The following table summarizes the activity related to our gross unrecognized tax benefits as of September 30, 2023, October 1, 2022 and October 2, 2021 (in millions):  2023 2022 2021 Balance as of the beginning of the year $ 152  $ 152  $ 165  Increases related to current year tax positions 7  16  25  Increases related to prior year tax positions 1  20  7  Reductions related to prior year tax positions ( 12 ) ( 13 ) ( 7 ) Reductions related to settlements —  ( 3 ) ( 1 ) Reductions related to expirations of statutes of limitations ( 17 ) ( 20 ) ( 37 ) Balance as of the end of the year $ 131  $ 152  $ 152   The amount of unrecognized tax benefits, if recognized, that would impact our effective tax rate was $ 98 million at September 30, 2023 and $ 112 million at October 1, 2022. We classify interest and penalties on unrecognized tax benefits as income tax expense. At September 30, 2023, and October 1, 2022, before tax benefits, we had $ 50 million and $ 47 million, respectively, of accrued interest and penalties on unrecognized tax benefits. In December 2021, we received an assessment from the Mexican tax authorities related to the 2015 sale of our direct and indirect equity interests in subsidiaries which held our Mexico operations. At September 30, 2023, the assessment totaled approximately $ 488 million ( 8.6 billion Mexican pesos), which includes tax, inflation adjustment, interest and penalties. We believe the assertions made in the assessment letter have no merit and will defend our positions through the Mexican administrative appeal process and litigation, if necessary. Based on our analysis of this assessment in accordance with FASB guidance related to unrecognized tax benefits, we have not recorded a liability related to the issue. As of September 30, 2023, certain United States federal income tax returns are subject to examination for fiscal years 2019 through 2022. We are also subject to income tax examinations by major state and foreign jurisdictions for fiscal years 2014 through 2022 and 2018 through 2022, respectively. We do not expect material changes to our unrecognized tax benefits during the next twelve months. On August 16, 2022, the Inflation Reduction Act of 2022 (“IRA”) was signed into law. The IRA made several changes to the U.S. tax code effective after December 31, 2022, including, but not limited to, a 15% minimum tax on large corporations with average annual financial statement income of more than $1 billion for a three tax-year period and a 1% excise tax on public company stock buybacks, which will be accounted for in treasury stock. These changes did not have any impact on our provision for income taxes or financial statements in fiscal 2023. NOTE 11: EARNINGS (LOSS) PER SHARE The earnings and weighted average common shares used in the computation of basic and diluted earnings per share are as follows for fiscal years ended 2023, 2022 and 2021 (in millions, except per share data):  2023 2022 2021 Numerator: Net income (loss) $ ( 649 ) $ 3,249  $ 3,060  Less: Net income (loss) attributable to noncontrolling interests ( 1 ) 11  13  Net income (loss) attributable to Tyson ( 648 ) 3,238  3,047  Less dividends declared: Class A 554  539  532  Class B 122  117  113  Undistributed earnings (losses) $ ( 1,324 ) $ 2,582  $ 2,402  Class A undistributed earnings (losses) $ ( 1,084 ) $ 2,122  $ 1,977  Class B undistributed earnings (losses) ( 240 ) 460  425  Total undistributed earnings (losses) $ ( 1,324 ) $ 2,582  $ 2,402  Denominator: Denominator for basic earnings (loss) per share: Class A weighted average shares 284  290  293  Class B weighted average shares 70  70  70  Denominator for diluted earnings (loss) per share: Class A weighted average shares 284  290  293  Class B weighted average shares under if-converted method for diluted earnings (loss) per share (a) — 70  70  Effect of dilutive securities: Stock options, restricted stock and performance units —  3  2  Denominator for diluted earnings (loss) per share – weighted average shares and assumed conversions (a) 284  363  365  Net income (loss) per share attributable to Tyson: Class A Basic $ ( 1.87 ) $ 9.18  $ 8.57  Class B Basic $ ( 1.68 ) $ 8.25  $ 7.70  Diluted (a) $ ( 1.87 ) $ 8.92  $ 8.34  Dividends Declared Per Share: Class A $ 1.940  $ 1.855  $ 1.805  Class B $ 1.746  $ 1.670  $ 1.625  (a) For fiscal 2023, as the Company is in a net loss position, the impact of the Class B shares under the if-converted method is antidilutive and therefore we have not assumed conversion. As a result, the Class B weighted average shares, dividends declared and undistributed losses were excluded for the purposes of calculating Net Income (Loss) Per Share Attributable to Tyson on a diluted basis. Approximately 9 million, 2 million, and 4 million of our stock-based compensation shares were antidilutive for fiscal 2023, 2022 and 2021. These shares were not included in the diluted earnings per share calculation. We have two classes of capital stock, Class A stock and Class B stock. Cash dividends cannot be paid to holders of Class B stock unless they are simultaneously paid to holders of Class A stock. The per share amount of cash dividends paid to holders of Class B stock cannot exceed 90 % of the cash dividends paid to holders of Class A stock. We allocate undistributed earnings (losses) based upon a 1 to 0.9 ratio per share to Class A stock and Class B stock, respectively. We allocate undistributed earnings (losses) based on this ratio due to historical dividend patterns, voting control of Class B shareholders and contractual limitations of dividends to Class B stock. NOTE 12: DERIVATIVE FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS Our business operations give rise to certain market risk exposures mostly due to changes in commodity prices, foreign currency exchange rates and interest rates. We manage a portion of these risks through the use of derivative financial instruments to reduce our exposure to commodity price risk, foreign currency risk and interest rate risk. Our risk management programs are periodically reviewed by our Board of Directors’ Audit Committee. These programs and risks are monitored by senior management and may be revised as market conditions dictate. Our current risk management programs utilize various industry-standard models that take into account the implicit cost of hedging. Credit risks associated with our derivative contracts are not significant as we minimize counterparty exposure by dealing with credit-worthy counterparties and utilizing exchange traded instruments, margin accounts or letters of credit. Additionally, our derivative contracts are mostly short-term in duration and we generally do not make use of credit-risk-related contingent features. No significant concentrations of credit risk existed at September 30, 2023. We had the following aggregated outstanding notional amounts related to our derivative financial instruments (in millions, except soybean meal tons):  Metric September 30, 2023 October 1, 2022 Commodity: Corn Bushels 65  44  Soybean Meal Tons 956,630  532,700  Live Cattle Pounds 319  280  Lean Hogs Pounds 454  339  Foreign Currency United States dollar $ 171  $ 249   We recognize all derivative instruments as either assets or liabilities at fair value in the Consolidated Balance Sheets, with the exception of normal purchases and normal sales expected to result in physical delivery. For those derivative instruments that are designated and qualify as hedging instruments, we designate the hedging instrument based upon the exposure being hedged (i.e., cash flow hedge or fair value hedge). We designate certain forward contracts as follows: • Cash Flow Hedges – include certain commodity forward and option contracts of forecasted purchases (i.e., grains), interest rate swaps and locks, and certain foreign exchange forward contracts. • Fair Value Hedges – include certain commodity forward contracts of firm commitments (i.e., livestock). Cash Flow Hedges Derivative instruments are designated as hedges against changes in the amount of future cash flows related to procurement of certain commodities utilized in our production processes as well as interest rates to our variable rate debt. For the derivative instruments we designate and qualify as a cash flow hedge, the effective portion of the gain or loss on the derivative is reported as a component of other comprehensive income (“OCI”) and reclassified into earnings in the same period or periods during which the hedged transaction affects earnings. Gains and losses representing hedge ineffectiveness are recognized in earnings in the current period. Ineffectiveness related to our cash flow hedges was not significant during fiscal 2023, 2022 and 2021. As of September 30, 2023, we have $ 12 million of realized losses related to treasury rate locks in connection with the issuance of the 2026, 2029 and 2048 Notes, which will be reclassified to earnings over the lives of these notes. During fiscal 2023, 2022 and 2021, we had no gains or losses recognized in OCI on derivatives designated as cash flow hedges. Fair Value Hedges We designate certain derivative contracts as fair value hedges of firm commitments to purchase livestock for harvest. Our objective of these hedges is to minimize the risk of changes in fair value created by fluctuations in commodity prices associated with fixed price livestock firm commitments. For these derivative instruments we designate and qualify as a fair value hedge, the gain or loss on the derivative, as well as the offsetting gain or loss on the hedged item attributable to the hedged risk, are recognized in earnings in the same period. We include the gain or loss on the hedged items (i.e., livestock purchase firm commitments) in the same line item, Cost of Sales, as the offsetting gain or loss on the related livestock forward position. Ineffectiveness related to our fair value hedges was not significant during fiscal 2023, 2022 and 2021. The carrying amount of fair value hedge (assets) liabilities as of fiscal 2023, 2022 and 2021 were as follows (in millions):  Consolidated Balance Sheets Classification 2023 2022 2021 Inventory $ 16  $ ( 12 ) $ ( 6 )  Undesignated Positions In addition to our designated positions, we also hold derivative contracts for which we do not apply hedge accounting. These include certain derivative instruments related to commodities price risk, including grains, livestock, energy and foreign currency risk. We mark these positions to fair value through earnings at each reporting date. Reclassification to Earnings The following table sets forth the total amounts of each income and expense line item presented in the Consolidated Statements of Income in which the effects of hedges are recorded for fiscal years ended 2023, 2022 and 2021(in millions):  Consolidated Statements of Income Classification 2023 2022 2021 Cost of Sales $ 50,250  $ 46,614  $ 40,523  Interest Expense 355  365  428  Other, net ( 42 ) ( 87 ) ( 65 ) The following table sets forth the pretax impact of the cash flow, fair value and undesignated derivative instruments in the Consolidated Statements of Income for fiscal years ended 2023, 2022 and 2021(in millions):  Consolidated Statements of Income Classification 2023 2022 2021 Cost of Sales Gain (Loss) on cash flow hedges reclassified from OCI to Earnings: Commodity contracts $ —  $ —  $ ( 1 ) Gain (Loss) on fair value hedges: Commodity contracts (a) ( 19 ) ( 29 ) ( 55 ) Gain (Loss) on derivatives not designated as hedging instruments: Commodity contracts ( 98 ) 254  70  Total $ ( 117 ) $ 225  $ 14  Interest Expense Gain (Loss) on cash flow hedges reclassified from OCI to Earnings: Interest rate contracts $ ( 2 ) $ ( 1 ) $ ( 1 ) Other, net Gain (Loss) on derivatives not designated as hedging instruments: Foreign exchange contracts $ 3  $ ( 9 ) $ ( 5 ) (a) Amounts represent gains/(losses) on commodity contracts designated as fair value hedges of firm commitments that were realized during the period presented, which were offset by a corresponding gain/(loss) on the underlying hedged inventory. Gains or losses related to changes in the fair value of unrealized commodity contracts, along with the offsetting gain or loss on the hedged inventory, are also marked-to-market through earnings with no impact on a net basis. The fair value of all outstanding derivative instruments in the Consolidated Balance Sheets are included in Note 13: Fair Value Measurements. NOTE 13: FAIR VALUE MEASUREMENTS Fair value is defined as the price that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability (an exit price) in the principal or most advantageous market for the asset or liability in an orderly transaction between market participants on the measurement date. The fair value hierarchy contains three levels as follows: Level 1 — Unadjusted quoted prices available in active markets for the identical assets or liabilities at the measurement date. Level 2 — Other observable inputs available at the measurement date, other than quoted prices included in Level 1, either directly or indirectly, including: • Quoted prices for similar assets or liabilities in active markets; • Quoted prices for identical or similar assets in non-active markets; • Inputs other than quoted prices that are observable for the asset or liability; and • Inputs derived principally from or corroborated by other observable market data. Level 3 — Unobservable inputs that cannot be corroborated by observable market data and reflect the use of significant management judgment. These values are generally determined using pricing models for which the assumptions utilize management’s estimates of market participant assumptions. Assets and Liabilities Measured at Fair Value on a Recurring Basis The fair value hierarchy requires the use of observable market data when available. In instances where the inputs used to measure fair value fall into different levels of the fair value hierarchy, the fair value measurement has been determined based on the lowest level input significant to the fair value measurement in its entirety. Our assessment of the significance of a particular item to the fair value measurement in its entirety requires judgment, including the consideration of inputs specific to the asset or liability. The following tables set forth by level within the fair value hierarchy our financial assets and liabilities accounted for at fair value on a recurring basis according to the valuation techniques we used to determine their fair values as of September 30, 2023 and October 1, 2022 (in millions):  September 30, 2023 Level 1 Level 2 Level 3 Netting (a) Total Other Current Assets: Derivative financial instruments: Designated as hedges $ —  $ 7  $ —  $ ( 2 ) $ 5  Undesignated —  95  —  ( 19 ) 76  Available for sale securities (current) —  15  —  — 15  Other Assets: Available for sale securities (non-current) —  59  30  — 89  Deferred compensation assets 27  375  —  — 402  Total Assets $ 27  $ 551  $ 30  $ ( 21 ) $ 587  Other Current Liabilities: Derivative financial instruments: Designated as hedges $ —  $ 27  $ —  $ ( 27 ) $ —  Undesignated —  126  —  ( 107 ) 19  Total Liabilities $ —  $ 153  $ —  $ ( 134 ) $ 19   October 1, 2022 Level 1 Level 2 Level 3 Netting (a) Total Other Current Assets: Derivative financial instruments: Designated as hedges $ —  $ 14  $ —  $ ( 6 ) $ 8  Undesignated —  154  —  ( 58 ) 96  Available for sale securities (current) —  1  —  — 1  Other Assets: Available for sale securities (non-current) —  65  35  — 100  Deferred Compensation assets 38  327  —  — 365  Total Assets $ 38  $ 561  $ 35  $ ( 64 ) $ 570  Other Current Liabilities: Derivative financial instruments: Designated as hedges $ —  $ 2  $ —  $ ( 2 ) $ —  Undesignated —  106  —  ( 72 ) 34  Total liabilities $ —  $ 108  $ —  $ ( 74 ) $ 34  (a) Our derivative assets and liabilities are presented in our Consolidated Balance Sheets on a net basis when a legally enforceable master netting arrangement exists between the counterparty to a derivative contract and us. Additionally, at September 30, 2023, and October 1, 2022, we had $ 113 million and $ 10 million, respectively, of net cash collateral posted with various counterparties where master netting arrangements exist and held no cash collateral. The following table provides a reconciliation between the beginning and ending balance of marketable debt securities measured at fair value on a recurring basis in the table above that used significant unobservable inputs (Level 3) as of September 30, 2023 and October 1, 2022 (in millions):  September 30, 2023 October 1, 2022 Balance at beginning of year $ 35  $ 48  Total realized and unrealized gains (losses): Included in other comprehensive income (loss) 1  ( 3 ) Purchases 10  8  Settlements ( 16 ) ( 18 ) Balance at end of year $ 30  $ 35   The following methods and assumptions were used to estimate the fair value of each class of financial instrument: Derivative Assets and Liabilities Our derivative financial instruments primarily include exchange-traded and over-the-counter contracts which are further described in Note 12: Derivative Financial Instruments. We record our derivative financial instruments at fair value using quoted market prices, adjusted where necessary for credit and non-performance risk and internal models that use readily observable market inputs as their basis, including current and forward market prices and rates. We classify these instruments in Level 2 when quoted market prices can be corroborated utilizing observable current and forward commodity market prices on active exchanges or observable market transactions. Available for Sale Securities Our investments in marketable debt securities are classified as available-for-sale and are reported at fair value based on pricing models and quoted market prices adjusted for credit and non-performance risk. Short-term investments with maturities of less than 12 months are included in Other current assets in the Consolidated Balance Sheets and primarily include certificates of deposit and commercial paper. All other marketable debt securities are included in Other Assets in the Consolidated Balance Sheets and have maturities ranging up to 46 years. We classify our investments in U.S. government, U.S. agency, certificates of deposit and commercial paper debt securities as Level 2 as fair value is generally estimated using discounted cash flow models that are primarily industry-standard models that consider various assumptions, including time value and yield curve as well as other readily available relevant economic measures. We classify certain corporate, asset-backed and other debt securities as Level 3 as there is limited activity or less observable inputs into valuation models, including current interest rates and estimated prepayment, default and recovery rates on the underlying portfolio or structured investment vehicle. Significant changes to assumptions or unobservable inputs in the valuation of our Level 3 instruments would not have a significant impact to our consolidated financial statements. The following table sets forth our available-for-sale securities’ amortized cost basis, fair value and unrealized gain (loss) by significant investment category as of September 30, 2023 and October 1, 2022 (in millions):  September 30, 2023 October 1, 2022 Amortized Cost Basis Fair Value Unrealized Gain/(Loss) Amortized Cost Basis Fair Value Unrealized Gain/(Loss) Available for Sale Securities: Debt Securities: United States Treasury and Agency $ 79  $ 74  $ ( 5 ) $ 71  $ 66  $ ( 5 ) Corporate and Asset-Backed 31  30  ( 1 ) 37  35  ( 2 )  Unrealized holding gains (losses), net of tax, are excluded from earnings and reported in OCI until the security is settled or sold. On a quarterly basis, we evaluate whether losses related to our available-for-sale securities are due to credit or noncredit factors. Losses on debt securities where we have the intent, or will more than likely be required, to sell the security prior to recovery, would be recorded as a direct write-off of amortized cost basis through earnings. Losses on debt securities where we do not have the intent, or would not more than likely be required to sell the security prior to recovery, would be further evaluated to determine whether the loss is credit or non-credit related. Credit-related losses would be recorded through an allowance for credit losses through earnings and non-credit related losses through OCI. We consider many factors in determining whether a loss is credit-related, including the financial condition and near-term prospects of the issuer, borrower repayment characteristics for asset-backed securities, and our ability and intent to hold the investment for a period of time sufficient to allow for any anticipated recovery. We recognized no direct write-offs or allowances for credit losses in earnings in fiscal 2023, 2022 or 2021. Deferred Compensation Assets We maintain non-qualified deferred compensation plans for certain executives and other highly compensated team members. Investments are generally maintained within a trust and include money market funds, mutual funds and life insurance policies. The cash surrender value of the life insurance policies is invested primarily in mutual funds. The investments are recorded at fair value based on quoted market prices and are included in Other Assets in the Consolidated Balance Sheets. We classify the investments which have observable market prices in active markets in Level 1 as these are generally publicly-traded mutual funds. The remaining deferred compensation assets are classified in Level 2, as fair value can be corroborated based on observable market data. Realized and unrealized gains (losses) on deferred compensation are included in earnings. Assets and Liabilities Measured at Fair Value on a Nonrecurring Basis In addition to assets and liabilities that are recorded at fair value on a recurring basis, we record assets and liabilities at fair value on a nonrecurring basis. Generally, assets are recorded at fair value on a nonrecurring basis as a result of impairment charges and, with respect to our equity investments without readily determinable fair values, recorded by applying the measurement alternative for which such investments are recorded at cost and adjusted for an observable price change in an orderly transaction for an identical or similar investment of the same issuer. In fiscal 2023, we recorded goodwill impairment charges of $ 333 million, $ 210 million and $ 238 million in our Beef and Chicken segments and International/Other, respectively. We estimated the fair value of our reporting units utilizing various valuation techniques, with the primary technique being an income approach (discounted cash flow method) and another technique being a market approach (guideline public company method), which incorporated significant unobservable Level 3 inputs. During fiscal 2022, we recognized gains of $ 37 million in Other, net in the Consolidated Statements of Income, based upon observable price changes. Equity investments without readily determinable fair values are measured using Level 3 inputs and are included in Other Assets in the Consolidated Balance Sheets. We did not have any other significant measurements of assets or liabilities at fair value on a nonrecurring basis subsequent to their initial recognition during the twelve months ended September 30, 2023, October 1, 2022, or October 2, 2021. Other Financial Instruments Fair value of our debt is principally estimated using Level 2 inputs based on quoted prices for those or similar instruments. Fair value and carrying value for our debt are as follows as of September 30, 2023 and October 1, 2022 (in millions):  September 30, 2023 October 1, 2022 Fair Value Carrying Value Fair Value Carrying Value Total Debt $ 8,693  $ 9,506  $ 7,762  $ 8,321   Concentrations of Credit Risk Our financial instruments exposed to concentrations of credit risk consist primarily of cash and cash equivalents and accounts receivable. Our cash equivalents are in high quality securities placed with major banks and financial institutions. Concentrations of credit risk with respect to receivables are limited due to the large number of customers and their dispersion across geographic areas. We perform periodic credit evaluations of our customers’ financial condition and generally do not require collateral. At September 30, 2023, and October 1, 2022, 15.9 % and 16.4 %, respectively, of our net accounts receivable balance was due from Walmart Inc. No other single customer or customer group represented greater than 10 % of net accounts receivable. NOTE 14: STOCK-BASED COMPENSATION We issue shares under our stock-based compensation plans by issuing Class A stock from treasury. The total number of shares available for future grant under the Tyson Foods, Inc. 2000 Stock Incentive Plan (“Incentive Plan”) was 6,923,370 at September 30, 2023. Stock Options Shareholders approved the Incentive Plan in January 2001. The Incentive Plan is administered by the Compensation and Leadership Development Committee of the Board of Directors (“Compensation Committee”). The Incentive Plan includes provisions for granting incentive stock options for shares of Class A stock at a price not less than the fair value at the date of grant. Nonqualified stock options may be granted at a price equal to or more than the fair value of Class A stock on the date the option is granted. Stock options under the Incentive Plan generally become exercisable ratably over three years from the date of grant and must be exercised within 10 years from the date of grant. Our policy is to recognize compensation expense on a straight-line basis over the requisite service period for the entire award. Forfeitures are recognized as they occur.  Shares Under Option Weighted Average Exercise Price Per Share Weighted Average Remaining Contractual Life (in Years) Aggregate Intrinsic Value (in millions) Outstanding, October 1, 2022 6,029,629  $ 67.95  Exercised ( 245,991 ) 47.15  Forfeited or expired ( 942,905 ) 71.52  Granted 1,539,275  65.55  Outstanding, September 30, 2023 6,380,008  $ 67.65  6.2 $ 7  Exercisable, September 30, 2023 4,422,711  $ 66.94  5.2 $ 7   The weighted average grant-date fair value of options granted in fiscal 2023, 2022 and 2021 was $ 15.82 , $ 16.53 and $ 11.03 , respectively. The fair value of each option grant is established on the date of grant using a binomial lattice method. We use historical volatility for a period of time comparable to the expected life of the option to determine volatility assumptions. Expected life is calculated based on the contractual term of each grant and takes into account the historical exercise and termination behavior of participants. Risk-free interest rates are based on the five-year Treasury bond rate. Assumptions used in the fair value calculation are as of the grant dates and are outlined in the following table.  2023 2022 2021 Expected life (in years) 4.5 4.4 4.3 Risk-free interest rate 3.9  % 1.1  % 0.3  % Expected volatility 31.2  % 30.0  % 32.2  % Expected dividend yield 2.9  % 2.4  % 3.4  %  We recognized stock-based compensation expense related to stock options, net of income taxes, of $ 13 million, $ 13 million and $ 19 million for fiscal 2023, 2022 and 2021, respectively. The related tax benefit for fiscal 2023, 2022 and 2021 was $ 3 million, $ 3 million and $ 4 million, respectively. We had 1.2 million, 1.5 million and 1.9 million options vest in fiscal 2023, 2022 and 2021, respectively, with a grant date fair value of $ 18 million, $ 19 million and $ 25 million, respectively. In fiscal 2023, 2022 and 2021, we received cash of $ 11 million, $ 126 million and $ 41 million, respectively, for the exercise of stock options. Shares are issued from treasury for stock option exercises. The related tax benefit realized from stock options exercised during fiscal 2023, 2022 and 2021, was $ 1 million, $ 12 million and $ 5 million, respectively. The total intrinsic value of options exercised in fiscal 2023, 2022 and 2021, was $ 1 million, $ 22 million and $ 20 million, respectively. As of September 30, 2023, we had $ 18 million of total unrecognized compensation cost related to stock option plans that will be recognized over a weighted average period of 1.1 years. Restricted Stock We issue restricted stock at the market value as of the date of grant, with restrictions expiring over periods through fiscal 2026. Unearned compensation is recognized over the vesting period for the particular grant using a straight-line method.  Number of Shares Weighted Average Grant- Date Fair Value Per Share Weighted Average Remaining Contractual Life (in Years) Aggregate Intrinsic Value (in millions) Nonvested, October 1, 2022 1,606,531  $ 76.36  Granted 1,006,545  62.23  Dividends 26,709  62.56  Vested ( 669,511 ) 79.38  Forfeited ( 334,359 ) 71.47  Nonvested, September 30, 2023 1,635,915  $ 67.20  1.5 $ 83   As of September 30, 2023, we had $ 50 million of total unrecognized compensation cost related to restricted stock awards that will be recognized over a weighted average period of 2.0 years. We recognized stock-based compensation expense related to restricted stock, net of income taxes, of $ 32 million, $ 28 million and $ 35 million for fiscal 2023, 2022 and 2021, respectively. The related tax benefit for fiscal 2023, 2022 and 2021 was $ 9 million, $ 7 million and $ 9 million, respectively. We had 0.7 million, 0.9 million and 0.5 million restricted stock awards vest in fiscal 2023, 2022 and 2021, respectively, with a grant date fair value of $ 53 million, $ 57 million and $ 37 million, respectively. Performance-Based Shares We award performance-based shares of our Class A stock to certain team members. These awards are typically granted once a year. Performance-based shares vest based upon the passage of time and the achievement of performance or market performance criteria, ranging from 0 % to 200 %, as determined by the Compensation Committee prior to the date of the award. Vesting periods for these awards are three years . We review progress toward the attainment of the performance criteria each quarter during the vesting period. When it is probable the minimum performance criteria for an award will be achieved, we begin recognizing the expense equal to the proportionate share of the total fair value of the Class A stock price on the grant date. The total expense recognized over the duration of performance awards will equal the Class A stock price on the date of grant multiplied by the number of shares ultimately awarded based on the level of attainment of the performance criteria. For grants with market performance criteria, the fair value is determined on the grant date and is calculated using the same inputs for expected volatility, expected dividend yield, and risk-free rate as stock options, noted above, with a duration of three years . The total expense recognized over the duration of the award will equal the fair value, regardless if the market performance criteria is met. The following table summarizes the performance-based shares at the maximum award amounts based upon the respective performance share agreements. Actual shares that will vest depend on the level of attainment of the performance-based criteria.  Number of Shares Weighted Average Grant- Date Fair Value Per Share Weighted Average Remaining Contractual Life (in Years) Aggregate Intrinsic Value (in millions) Nonvested, October 1, 2022 1,781,519  $ 58.13  Granted 938,835  48.80  Vested ( 243,782 ) 90.05  Forfeited ( 830,423 ) 50.74  Nonvested, September 30, 2023 1,646,149  $ 51.81  1.2 $ 83   We recognized stock-based compensation expense related to performance shares, net of income taxes, of $ 2 million, $ 37 million and $ 19 million for fiscal 2023, 2022 and 2021, respectively. The related tax benefit for fiscal 2023 was inconsequential. The related tax benefit for fiscal 2022 and 2021 was $ 7 million and $ 4 million, respectively. As of September 30, 2023, we had $ 6 million of total unrecognized compensation based upon our progress toward the attainment of criteria related to performance-based share awards that will be recognized over a weighted average period of 1.6 years. NOTE 15: PENSIONS AND OTHER POSTRETIREMENT BENEFITS We have four defined benefit pension plans consisting of one frozen and noncontributory funded qualified plan and three frozen unfunded non-qualified plans. The benefits provided under these plans are based on a formula using years of service and either a specified benefit rate or compensation level. The non-qualified defined benefit plans are for certain officers and use a formula based on years of service and final average salary. We also have other postretirement benefit plans for which substantially all of our team members may receive benefits if they satisfy applicable eligibility criteria. The postretirement healthcare plans are contributory with participants’ contributions adjusted when deemed necessary. We have defined contribution retirement programs for various groups of team members. We recognized expenses of $ 113 million, $ 114 million and $ 106 million in fiscal 2023, 2022 and 2021, respectively. We use a fiscal year end measurement date for our defined benefit plans and other postretirement plans. We recognize the effect of actuarial gains and losses into earnings immediately for other postretirement plans rather than amortizing the effect over future periods. Other postretirement benefits include postretirement medical costs and life insurance. During fiscal 2021, we amended one of the Company’s other postretirement benefit plans, which resulted in the recognition of a gain of $ 34 million, recorded in Other, net in our Consolidated Statements of Income. Benefit Obligations and Funded Status The following table provides a reconciliation of the changes in the plans’ benefit obligations, assets and funded status as of September 30, 2023 and October 1, 2022 (in millions):  Pension Benefits Other Postretirement Qualified Non-Qualified Benefits 2023 2022 2023 2022 2023 2022 Change in benefit obligation Benefit obligation at beginning of year $ 17  $ 28  $ 166  $ 220  $ 55  $ 65  Service cost —  —  —  —  2  1  Interest cost 1  1  8  6  1  1  Actuarial (gain)/loss 1  ( 11 ) ( 3 ) ( 47 ) ( 5 ) ( 8 ) Benefits paid ( 1 ) ( 1 ) ( 13 ) ( 13 ) ( 3 ) ( 4 ) Benefit obligation at end of year 18  17  158  166  50  55  Change in plan assets Fair value of plan assets at beginning of year 24  33  —  —  —  —  Actual return on plan assets 4  ( 9 ) —  —  —  —  Employer contributions —  1  13  13  3  4  Benefits paid ( 1 ) ( 1 ) ( 13 ) ( 13 ) ( 3 ) ( 4 ) Fair value of plan assets at end of year 27  24  —  —  —  —  Funded status $ 9  $ 7  $ ( 158 ) $ ( 166 ) $ ( 50 ) $ ( 55 )  Amounts recognized in the Consolidated Balance Sheets as of September 30, 2023 and October 1, 2022 consist of (in millions):  Pension Benefits Other Postretirement Qualified Non-Qualified Benefits 2023 2022 2023 2022 2023 2022 Other assets $ 9  $ 7  $ —  $ —  $ —  $ —  Other current liabilities —  —  ( 13 ) ( 13 ) ( 2 ) ( 3 ) Other liabilities —  —  ( 145 ) ( 153 ) ( 48 ) ( 52 ) Total assets (liabilities) $ 9  $ 7  $ ( 158 ) $ ( 166 ) $ ( 50 ) $ ( 55 )  Pre-tax amounts recognized in Accumulated Other Comprehensive Income as of September 30, 2023 and October 1, 2022 consist of (in millions):  Pension Benefits Other Postretirement Qualified Non-Qualified Benefits 2023 2022 2023 2022 2023 2022 Accumulated other comprehensive (income)/loss: Actuarial (gain) loss $ 1  $ 2  $ ( 15 ) $ ( 15 ) $ 9  $ 13  Prior service (credit) cost —  —  1  2  ( 5 ) ( 5 ) Total accumulated other comprehensive (income)/loss: $ 1  $ 2  $ ( 14 ) $ ( 13 ) $ 4  $ 8   We had three pension plans as of September 30, 2023 and October 1, 2022, that had an accumulated benefit obligation in excess of plan assets. Plans with accumulated benefit obligations in excess of plan assets are as follows (in millions):  Pension Benefits Qualified Non-Qualified 2023 2022 2023 2022 Projected benefit obligation $ —  $ —  $ 158  $ 166  Accumulated benefit obligation —  —  158  166  Fair value of plan assets —  —  —  —   The accumulated benefit obligation for all qualified pension plans was $ 18 million and $ 17 million at September 30, 2023, and October 1, 2022, respectively. Net Periodic Benefit Cost (Credit) Components of net periodic benefit cost (credit) for pension and postretirement benefit plans recognized in the Consolidated Statements of Income are as follows for fiscal years ended 2023, 2022 and 2021 (in millions):  Pension Benefits Other Postretirement Qualified Non-Qualified Benefits 2023 2022 2021 2023 2022 2021 2023 2022 2021 Service cost $ —  $ —  $ —  $ —  $ —  $ —  $ 2  $ 1  $ 2  Interest cost 1  1  —  8  6  6  1  1  1  Expected return on plan assets ( 1 ) ( 1 ) —  —  —  —  —  —  —  Amortization of prior service cost —  —  —  1  1  1  5  4  ( 2 ) Recognized actuarial loss (gain), net —  —  —  ( 3 ) 3  4  ( 5 ) ( 8 ) —  Recognized settlement gain —  —  —  —  —  —  —  —  ( 34 ) Net periodic benefit cost (credit) $ —  $ —  $ —  $ 6  $ 10  $ 11  $ 3  $ ( 2 ) $ ( 33 )  Each of the components other than the service cost component were recorded in the Consolidated Statements of Income in Other, net. As of September 30, 2023, we expect no amounts to be reclassified into earnings within the next 12 months related to net periodic benefit cost (credit) for the qualified pension plans. As of September 30, 2023, the amounts expected to be reclassified into earnings within the next 12 months related to net periodic benefit cost (credit) for the non-qualified pension plans and the other postretirement benefit plans are not significant. Assumptions Weighted average assumptions are as follows for fiscal years ended 2023, 2022 and 2021:  Pension Benefits Other Postretirement Qualified Non-Qualified Benefits 2023 2022 2021 2023 2022 2021 2023 2022 2021 Discount rate to determine net periodic benefit cost 5.20  % 2.00  % 1.70  % 5.42  % 2.83  % 2.63  % 4.59  % 2.07  % 1.95  % Discount rate to determine benefit obligations 5.70  % 5.20  % 2.00  % 5.79  % 5.42  % 2.83  % 4.92  % 4.59  % 2.07  % Rate of compensation increase n/a n/a n/a n/a n/a n/a n/a n/a n/a Expected return on plan assets 5.20  % 2.00  % 1.70  % n/a n/a n/a n/a n/a n/a  To determine the expected return on plan assets assumption, we first examined historical rates of return for the various asset classes within the plans. We then determined a long-term projected rate-of-return based on expected returns. Our discount rate assumptions used to account for pension and other postretirement benefit plans reflect the rates at which the benefit obligations could be effectively settled. The discount rates for our plans were determined using a cash flow matching technique whereby the rates of a yield curve, developed from high-quality debt securities, were applied to the benefit obligations to determine the appropriate discount rate. We have eight other postretirement benefit plans, of which five are healthcare and life insurance related. Two of these plans, with benefit obligations totaling $ 9 million at September 30, 2023, were not impacted by healthcare cost trend rates as one consists of fixed annual payments and one is life insurance related. One of the healthcare plans, with benefit obligations less than $ 1 million at September 30, 2023, was not impacted by healthcare cost trend rates due to previous plan amendments. The remaining two plans, with benefit obligations less than $ 1 million and $ 3 million, at September 30, 2023, utilized assumed healthcare cost trend rates of 7.1 % and 7.0 %, respectively. The healthcare cost trend rates for the two plans will be grading down to an ultimate rate of 4.5 % in 2032 and 2031, respectively. Contributions Our policy is to fund at least the minimum contribution required to meet applicable federal employee benefit and local tax laws. In our sole discretion, we may from time to time fund additional amounts. Expected contributions to pension plans for fiscal 2024 are approximately $ 15 million. For fiscal 2023, 2022 and 2021, we funded $ 13 million, $ 13 million and $ 15 million, respectively, to pension plans. Estimated Future Benefit Payments The following benefit payments are expected to be paid (in millions):  Pension Benefits Other Postretirement Qualified Non-Qualified Benefits 2024 $ 1  $ 14  $ 2  2025 1  14  2  2026 —  14  3  2027 —  13  2  2028 —  13  2  2029-2033 5  62  7  The above benefit payments for other postretirement benefit plans are not expected to be offset by Medicare Part D subsidies in fiscal 2024. Multi-Employer Plan Additionally, we participate in one multi-employer plan that provides defined benefits to certain team members covered by collective bargaining agreements. Such plans are usually administered by a board of trustees composed of the management of the participating companies and labor representatives. The risks of participating in multi-employer plans are different from single-employer plans. Assets contributed to the multi-employer plan by one employer may be used to provide benefits to team members of other participating employers. If a participating employer stops contributing to the plan, the unfunded obligation of the plan may be borne by the remaining participating employers. If we stop participating in a plan, we may be required to pay that plan an amount based on the underfunded status of the plan, referred to as a withdrawal liability. The net pension cost of the plan is equal to the annual contributions determined in accordance with the provisions of negotiated labor contracts. Contributions to the plan were $ 2 million in fiscal 2023 and fiscal 2022. Assets contributed to such plans are not segregated or otherwise restricted to provide benefits only to our team members. The future cost of the plans is dependent on a number of factors including the funded status of the plans and the ability of the other participating companies to meet ongoing funding obligations. Our participation in the multi-employer plan for fiscal 2023 is outlined below. The EIN/Pension Plan Number column provides the Employer Identification Number (“EIN”) and the three-digit plan number. The most recent Pension Protection Act (“PPA”) zone status available in fiscal 2023 and fiscal 2022 is for the plan’s year beginning January 1, 2023, and 2022, respectively. The zone status is based on information that we have received from the plan and is certified by the plan’s actuaries. Among other factors, plans in the red zone are generally less than 65 percent funded. Plans that are critical and declining status are projected to have an accumulated funding deficiency. The FIP/RP Status column indicates plans for which a financial improvement plan (“FIP”) or rehabilitation plan (“RP”) is either pending or has been implemented. The last column lists the expiration date of the collective-bargaining agreement to which the plan is subject. In addition to regular contributions, we could be obligated to pay additional contributions (known as complete or partial withdrawal liabilities) if it has unfunded vested benefits.

Sales to Walmart Inc. were included in all the segments. Any extended discontinuance of sales to this customer could, if not replaced, have a material impact on our operations. The majority of our operations are domiciled in the United States. Approximately 95 % of sales to external customers for each of fiscal 2023, 2022 and 2021 were sourced from the United States. Approximately $ 26.1 billion and $ 25.7 billion of long-lived assets were located in the United States at September 30, 2023, and October 1, 2022, respectively. Excluding goodwill and intangible assets, long-lived assets located in the United States totaled approximately $ 10.5 billion and $ 9.5 billion at September 30, 2023, and October 1, 2022, respectively. Approximately $ 1.4 billion and $ 1.5 billion of long-lived assets were located in foreign locations, primarily Brazil, China, the European Union, Malaysia, New Zealand and Thailand at September 30, 2023, and October 1, 2022, respectively. Excluding goodwill and intangible assets, long-lived assets in foreign countries totaled approximately $ 1,101 million and $ 916 million at September 30, 2023, and October 1, 2022, respectively. We sell certain products in foreign markets, primarily Australia, Canada, Central America, Chile, China, the European Union, the United Kingdom, Japan, Mexico, Malaysia, the Middle East, Singapore, South Korea, Taiwan and Thailand. Our export sales from the United States totaled $ 5.1 billion, $ 5.8 billion and $ 4.9 billion for fiscal 2023, 2022 and 2021, respectively. Substantially all of our export sales are facilitated through unaffiliated brokers, marketing associations and foreign sales staffs. Sales of products produced in a country other than the United States were less than 10 % of consolidated sales for each of fiscal 2023, 2022 and 2021.

For fiscal 2023 and 2021, the Chicken segment included a $ 156 million and $ 545 million reduction in Other due to the recognition of legal contingency accruals, respectively . NOTE 18: SUPPLEMENTAL CASH FLOWS INFORMATION The following table summarizes cash payments for interest and income taxes for fiscal years ended 2023, 2022 and 2021 (in millions):  2023 2022 2021 Interest, net of amounts capitalized $ 340  $ 363  $ 444  Income taxes, net of refunds 46  1,216  683   NOTE 19: TRANSACTIONS WITH RELATED PARTIES We have related party leases for two wastewater facilities with an entity owned by the Donald J. Tyson Revocable Trust (for which Mr. John Tyson, Chairman of the Company, is a trustee), Berry Street Waste Water Treatment Plant, LP ( 90 % of which is owned by the TLP), and the sisters of Mr. Tyson. As of September 30, 2023 and October 1, 2022, one lease was classified as a finance lease with a debt balance of $ 6 million which is primarily recognized as Long-term debt in our Consolidated Balance Sheet. The other lease was classified as an operating lease with a lease liability balance of $ 2 million and $ 3 million as of September 30, 2023 and October 1, 2022, respectively, which is primarily recognized within Other Liabilities in our Consolidated Balance Sheet. Total payments of approximately $ 1 million in each of fiscal 2023, 2022 and 2021 were paid to lease the facilities. As of September 30, 2023, the TLP, of which John Tyson and director Barbara Tyson are general partners, owned 70 million shares, or 99.985 % of our outstanding Class B stock and, along with the members of the Tyson family, owned 6.9 million shares of Class A stock, giving it control of approximately 71.74 % of the total voting power of our outstanding voting stock. In fiscal 2023, 2022 and 2021, the Company provided administrative services to the TLP, the beneficial owner of 70 million shares of Class B stock, and the TLP, through TLP Investment, L.P., reimbursed the Company $ 0.2 million in each of fiscal 2023 , 2022 and 2021. NOTE 20: COMMITMENTS AND CONTINGENCIES Commitments We guarantee obligations of certain outside third parties, consisting primarily of grower loans, which are substantially collateralized by the underlying assets. The remaining terms of the underlying obligations cover periods up to 8 years, and the maximum potential amount of future payments as of September 30, 2023, was not significant. The likelihood of material payments under these guarantees is not considered probable. At September 30, 2023, and October 1, 2022, no significant liabilities for guarantees were recorded. We have cash flow assistance programs in which certain livestock suppliers participate. Under these programs, we pay an amount for livestock equivalent to a standard cost to grow such livestock during periods of low market sales prices. The amounts of such payments that are in excess of the market sales price are recorded as receivables and accrue interest. Participating suppliers are obligated to repay these receivables balances when market sales prices exceed this standard cost, or upon termination of the agreement. Our maximum commitment associated with these programs is limited to the fair value of each participating livestock supplier’s net tangible assets. The potential maximum obligation as of September 30, 2023, was approximately $ 295 million. The total receivables under these programs were $ 12 million and $ 6 million at September 30, 2023 and October 1, 2022, respectively. These receivables are included, net of allowance for uncollectible amounts, in Accounts Receivable in our Consolidated Balance Sheets. Even though these programs are limited to the net tangible assets of the participating livestock suppliers, we also manage a portion of our credit risk associated with these programs by obtaining security interests in livestock suppliers’ assets. After analyzing residual credit risks and general market conditions, we have recorded an allowance for these program's estimated uncollectible receivables of $ 8 million at September 30, 2023 and no allowance for these programs at October 1, 2022, respectively. When constructing new facilities or making major enhancements to existing facilities, we will occasionally enter into incentive agreements with local government agencies in order to reduce certain state and local tax expenditures. These funds are generally considered restricted cash, which is reported in the Consolidated Balance Sheets in Other Assets. We had no deposits at September 30, 2023 and October 1, 2022. Additionally, under certain agreements, we transfer the related assets to various local government entities and receive Industrial Revenue Bonds. We immediately lease the facilities from the local government entities and have an option to re-purchase the facilities for a nominal amount upon tendering the Industrial Revenue Bonds to the local government entities at various predetermined dates. The Industrial Revenue Bonds and the associated obligations for the leases of the facilities offset, and the underlying assets remain in property, plant and equipment. At September 30, 2023, total amounts under these types of arrangements totaled $ 797 million. Additionally, we enter into other purchase commitments for various items such as grains, livestock contracts and variable livestock grower commitments that are estimable and have a remaining term in excess of one year, which as of September 30, 2023 were (in millions):  Purchase Obligations 2024 $ 424  2025 293  2026 151  2027 79  2028 50  2029 and beyond 149  Total $ 1,146  Contingencies In the normal course of business, we are involved in various claims, lawsuits, investigations and legal proceedings, including those specifically identified below. Each quarter, we determine whether to accrue for loss contingencies based on our assessment of whether the potential loss is probable, reasonably possible or remote and to the extent a loss is probable, whether it is reasonably estimable. We record accruals in the Company’s Consolidated Financial Statements for matters that we conclude are probable and the financial impact is reasonably estimable. Regardless of the manner of resolution, frequently the most significant changes in the status of a matter may occur over a short time period, often following a lengthy period of little substantive activity. While these accruals reflect the Company’s best estimate of the probable loss for those matters as of the dates of those accruals, the recorded amounts may differ materially from the actual amount of the losses for those matters. Listed below are certain claims made against the Company for which the magnitude of the potential exposure could be material to the Company’s Consolidated Financial Statements. Broiler Antitrust Civil Litigation Beginning in September 2016, a series of putative federal class action lawsuits styled In re Broiler Chicken Antitrust Litigation (the “Broiler Antitrust Civil Litigation”) were filed in the United States District Court for the Northern District of Illinois against us and certain of our poultry subsidiaries, as well as several other poultry processing companies. The operative complaints, which have been amended throughout the litigation, contain allegations that, among other things, assert that beginning in January 2008, the defendants conspired and combined to fix, raise, maintain, and stabilize the price of broiler chickens in violation of United States antitrust laws. The plaintiffs also allege that defendants “manipulated and artificially inflated a widely used Broiler price index, the Georgia Dock.” The plaintiffs further allege that the defendants concealed this conduct from the plaintiffs and the members of the putative classes. The plaintiffs seek treble damages, injunctive relief, pre- and post-judgment interest, costs, and attorneys’ fees on behalf of the putative classes. In addition, the complaints on behalf of the putative classes of indirect purchasers include causes of action under various state unfair competition laws, consumer protection laws, and unjust enrichment common laws. Since the original filing, certain putative class members have opted out of the matter and are proceeding with individual direct actions making similar claims, and others may do so in the future. The first trial in this matter, which involves claims brought by the Direct Purchaser Plaintiff Class and certain direct-action plaintiffs, began on September 12, 2023. The Company did not participate in the first trial as it had settled all of its claims with the plaintiffs in the first trial. Settlements On January 19, 2021, we announced that we had reached agreements to settle certain class claims related to the Broiler Antitrust Civil Litigation. Settlement terms were reached with the putative Direct Purchaser Plaintiff Class, the putative Commercial and Institutional Indirect Purchaser Plaintiff Class and the putative End-User Plaintiff Class (collectively, the “Classes”). Under the terms of the settlements, we agreed to pay the Classes an aggregate amount of $ 221.5 million in settlement of all outstanding claims brought by the Classes. On February 23, 2021, March 22, 2021 and October 15, 2021, the Court granted preliminary approval of the settlements with the putative Direct Purchaser Plaintiff Class, the putative End-User Plaintiff Class and the putative Commercial and Institutional Indirect Purchaser Plaintiff Class, respectively. On June 29, 2021, December 20, 2021 and April 18, 2022, the Court granted final approval to the settlements with the Direct Purchaser Plaintiff Class, the End-User Plaintiff Class and the Commercial and Institutional Indirect Purchaser Plaintiff Class, respectively. The foregoing settlements do not settle claims made by plaintiffs who opt out of the Classes in the Broiler Antitrust Civil Litigation. We are currently pursuing settlement discussions with the remaining opt-out plaintiffs with respect to the remaining claims. While we do not admit any liability as part of the settlements, we believe that the settlements were in the best interests of the Company and its shareholders to avoid the uncertainty, risk, expense and distraction of protracted litigation. During fiscal years 2023 and 2021 , the Company recorded aggregate legal contingency accruals of $ 146 million and $ 545 million, respectively, for claims related to this matter. Additionally, d uring fiscal years 2023, 2022 and 2021, the Company reduced its total recorded legal contingency accrual by $ 94 million, $ 343 million and $ 80 million, respectively, for amounts it had paid related to this matter. Accordingly, at September 30, 2023 and October 1, 2022, the legal contingency accrual for claims related to this matter was $ 174 million and $ 122 million, respectively. Government Investigations U.S. Department of Justice (“DOJ”) Antitrust Division . On June 21, 2019, the DOJ filed a motion to intervene and sought a limited stay of discovery in the Broiler Antitrust Civil Litigation, which the court granted in part. Subsequently, we received a grand jury subpoena from the DOJ seeking additional documents and information related to the chicken industry. On June 2, 2020, a grand jury for the District of Colorado returned an indictment charging four individual executives employed by two other poultry processing companies with conspiracy to engage in bid-rigging in violation of federal antitrust laws. On June 10, 2020, we announced that we uncovered information in connection with the grand jury subpoena that we had previously self-reported to the DOJ and have been cooperating with the DOJ as part of our application for leniency under the DOJ’s Corporate Leniency Program. Subsequently, the DOJ has announced indictments against additional individuals, as well as other poultry processing companies, alleging a conspiracy to fix prices and rig bids for broiler chicken products from at least 2012 until at least early 2019. In August 2021, the Company was granted conditional leniency by the DOJ for the matters we self-reported, which means that provided the Company continues to cooperate with the DOJ, neither the Company nor any of our cooperating employees will face prosecution or criminal fines or penalties. We continue to cooperate with the DOJ in connection with the ongoing federal antitrust investigation. State Matters . The Offices of the Attorneys General in New Mexico, Alaska and Washington have filed complaints against us and certain of our poultry subsidiaries, as well as several other poultry processing companies and Agri Stats, Inc., an information services provider (“Agri Stats”). The complaints are based on allegations similar to those asserted in the Broiler Antitrust Civil Litigation and allege violations of state antitrust, unfair trade practice, and unjust enrichment laws. In October 2022, we reached an agreement to settle all claims with the Washington Attorney General for $ 10.5 million for which the Company recorded an accrual in its Consolidated Financial Statements as of October 1, 2022, The Company paid the settlement during fiscal 2023. While we do not admit any liability as part of the settlement, we believe that the settlement was in the best interests of the Company and its shareholders to avoid the uncertainty, risk, expense and distraction of protracted litigation. We are cooperating with various state governmental agencies and officials, including the Offices of the Attorneys General for Florida and Louisiana, investigating or otherwise seeking information, testimony and/or documents, regarding the conduct alleged in the Broiler Antitrust Civil Litigation and related matters. While the Company believes it has meritorious defenses to the claims that have been made, we are exploring whether it is possible to resolve them in such a way that will serve the best interests of the Company and its shareholders and avoid the uncertainty, risk, expense and distraction of protracted litigation. As of September 30, 2023, the Company recorded an accrual for the estimated probable losses that it expects to incur for this matter in the Company's Consolidated Financial Statements. Broiler Chicken Grower Litigation On January 27, 2017 and March 26, 2017, putative class action complaints were filed against us and certain of our poultry subsidiaries, as well as several other vertically integrated poultry processing companies, in the United States District Court for the Eastern District of Oklahoma styled In re Broiler Chicken Grower Litigation. The plaintiffs allege, among other things, that the defendants colluded not to compete for broiler raising services “with the purpose and effect of fixing, maintaining, and/or stabilizing grower compensation below competitive levels.” The plaintiffs also allege that the defendants “agreed to share detailed data on [g]rower compensation with one another, with the purpose and effect of artificially depressing [g]rower compensation below competitive levels.” The plaintiffs contend these alleged acts constitute violations of the Sherman Antitrust Act and Section 202 of the Grain Inspection, Packers and Stockyards Act of 1921. The plaintiffs are seeking treble damages, pre- and post-judgment interest, costs, and attorneys’ fees on behalf of the putative class. Additional named plaintiffs filed similar class action complaints in federal district courts in North Carolina, Colorado, Kansas and California. All actions were subsequently consolidated in the Eastern District of Oklahoma. In June 2021, we reached an agreement to settle with the putative class of broiler chicken farmers all claims raised in this consolidated action on terms not material to the Company for which the Company recorded an accrual in its Consolidated Financial Statements as of October 2, 2021. The Court granted preliminary approval of the settlement on August 23, 2021 and final approval on February 18, 2022, and the Company paid the settlement during fiscal 2022. The DOJ’s Antitrust Division opened a civil investigation into broiler chicken grower contracts and alleged non-competitive practices involving performance-based compensation sharing for the purpose of stabilizing compensation below competitive levels. We continue to cooperate with the investigation. Pork Antitrust Litigation Beginning June 18, 2018, a series of putative class action complaints were filed against us and certain of our pork subsidiaries, as well as several other pork processing companies, in the United States District Court for the District of Minnesota styled In re Pork Antitrust Litigation (the “Pork Antitrust Civil Litigation”). The plaintiffs allege, among other things, that beginning in January 2009, the defendants conspired and combined to fix, raise, maintain, and stabilize the price of pork and pork products in violation of federal antitrust laws. The complaints on behalf of the putative classes of indirect purchasers also include causes of action under various state unfair competition laws, consumer protection laws, and unjust enrichment common laws. The plaintiffs seek treble damages, injunctive relief, pre- and post-judgment interest, costs, and attorneys’ fees on behalf of the putative classes. Since the original filing, certain putative class members have opted out of the matter and are proceeding with individual direct actions making similar claims, and others may do so in the future. The Company has not recorded any liability for this matter as it does not believe a loss is probable or reasonably estimable because the Company believes that it has valid and meritorious defenses against the allegations. The Offices of the Attorney General in New Mexico and Alaska have filed complaints against us and certain of our pork subsidiaries, as well as several other pork processing companies and Agri Stats. The complaints are based on allegations similar to those asserted in the Pork Antitrust Civil Litigation and allege violations of state antitrust, unfair trade practice, and unjust enrichment laws based on allegations of conspiracies to exchange information and manipulate the supply of pork. The Company has not recorded any liability for the foregoing matters as it does not believe a loss is probable or reasonably estimable at this time. Beef Antitrust Litigation On April 23, 2019, a putative class action complaint was filed against us and our beef and pork subsidiary, Tyson Fresh Meats, Inc. (“Tyson Fresh Meats”), as well as other beef packer defendants, in the United States District Court for the Northern District of Illinois. The plaintiffs allege that the defendants engaged in a conspiracy from January 2015 to the present to reduce fed cattle prices in violation of federal antitrust laws, the Grain Inspection, Packers and Stockyards Act of 1921, and the Commodities Exchange Act by periodically reducing their slaughter volumes so as to reduce demand for fed cattle, curtailing their purchases and slaughters of cash-purchased cattle during those same periods, coordinating their procurement practices for fed cattle settled on a cash basis, importing foreign cattle at a loss so as to reduce domestic demand, and closing and idling plants. In addition, the plaintiffs also allege the defendants colluded to manipulate live cattle futures and options traded on the Chicago Mercantile Exchange. The plaintiffs seek, among other things, treble monetary damages, punitive damages, restitution, and pre- and post-judgment interest, as well as declaratory and injunctive relief. Other similar lawsuits were filed by cattle ranchers in other district courts which were then transferred to the United States District Court for the District of Minnesota and consolidated and styled as In Re Cattle Antitrust Litigation . On February 18, 2021, we moved to dismiss the amended complaints, and on September 14, 2021, the court granted the motion with respect to certain state law claims but denied the motion with respect to the plaintiffs’ federal antitrust claims. The Company has not recorded any liability for this matter as it does not believe a loss is probable or reasonably estimable at this time because the Company believes that it has valid and meritorious defenses against the allegations and because the classes have not yet been defined or certified by the court. On April 26, 2019, a putative class of indirect purchasers filed a class action complaint against us, other beef packers, and Agri Stats in the United States District Court for the District of Minnesota. The plaintiffs allege that the packer defendants conspired to reduce slaughter capacity by closing or idling plants, limiting their purchases of cash cattle, coordinating their procurement of cash cattle, and reducing their slaughter numbers so as to reduce beef output, all in order to artificially raise prices of beef. The plaintiffs seek, among other things, damages under state antitrust and consumer protection statutes and the common law of approximately 30 states, as well as injunctive relief. The indirect consumer purchaser litigation is styled Peterson v. JBS USA Food Company Holdings, et al . Additional complaints have been filed on behalf of a putative class of direct purchasers of beef containing allegations of violations of Section 1 of the Sherman Act based on an alleged conspiracy to artificially fix, raise, and stabilize the wholesale price for beef, as well as on behalf of a putative class of commercial and institutional indirect purchasers of beef containing allegations of violations of Section 1 of the Sherman Act, various state antitrust laws and unjust enrichment based on an alleged conspiracy to artificially inflate the price for beef. On February 18, 2021, we moved to dismiss the plaintiffs’ amended complaints, and on September 14, 2021, the court granted the motion with respect to certain state law claims but denied the motion with respect to the plaintiffs’ federal antitrust claims. Since the original filing, certain putative class members have opted out of the matter and are proceeding with individual direct actions making similar claims, and others may do so in the future. The Company has not recorded any liability for this matter as it does not believe a loss is probable or reasonably estimable at this time because the Company believes that it has valid and meritorious defenses against the allegations and because the classes have not yet been defined or certified by the court. On February 18, 2022, a putative class action was commenced against us, Tyson Fresh Meats, and other beef packer defendants in the Supreme Court of British Columbia styled Bui v. Cargill, Incorporated et al. The plaintiff alleges that the defendants conspired to fix, maintain, increase, or control the price of beef, as well as to fix, maintain, control, prevent, or lessen the production or supply of beef by agreeing to reduce the number of cattle slaughtered, reduce slaughter capacity, refrain from increasing slaughter and beef processing capacity, limit purchases of cattle on the cash market, and coordinate purchases of and bids for cattle to lower the supply of fed cattle. The plaintiff advances causes of action under the Competition Act, civil conspiracy, unjust enrichment, and the Civil Code of Québec. The plaintiff seeks to certify a class comprised of all persons or entities in Canada who directly or indirectly purchased beef in Canada, either for resale or for their own consumption between January 1, 2015, and the present and seeks declarations regarding the alleged conspiracy, general damages, aggravated, exemplary, and punitive damages, injunctive relief, costs, and interest. On March 24, 2022, a putative class action was commenced against the same defendants in the Superior Court of Québec styled De Bellefeuille v. Cargill, Incorporated et al. The plaintiff is making substantially the same allegations as those made in the British Columbia action. On behalf of the putative class of persons who purchased beef in Québec since January 1, 2015, the plaintiff is seeking compensatory damages, costs of investigation and interest. The Company has not recorded any liability for the foregoing matters as it does not believe a loss is probable or reasonably estimable at this time because the proceedings are in preliminary stages. On October 31, 2022, a class action complaint was filed on behalf of putative classes of indirect cattle producers against us, Tyson Fresh Meats, and other beef packer defendants in the United States District Court for the District of Kansas. The plaintiffs allege that the defendants engaged in a conspiracy in violation of Section 1 of the Sherman Act, the Packers and Stockyards Act of 1921 and various state unfair competition and consumer protection laws from January 2015 to the present to reduce the price of cows, cattle, calves, steers or heifers by periodically reducing their slaughter volumes so as to reduce demand for fed cattle, curtailing their purchases and slaughters of cash-purchased cattle during those same periods, coordinating their procurement practices for fed cattle settled on a cash basis, importing foreign cattle at a loss so as to reduce domestic demand, and closing and idling plants. The plaintiffs seek, among other things, treble monetary damages, punitive damages, restitution, and pre- and post-judgment interest under state antitrust and consumer protection statutes and the common law of approximately 33 states, as well as declaratory and injunctive relief. The indirect producer litigation is styled Sprecht et. al. v. Tyson, Inc., et al . In November 2022, the case was transferred and consolidated with In re Cattle and Beef Antitrust Litigation , MDL No. 3031. On February 3, 2023, we moved to dismiss the complaint, and the court granted the motion on August 17, 2023 but later permitted the plaintiffs to amend their complaint. The Company has not recorded any liability for this matter as it does not believe a loss is probable or reasonably estimable at this time because the Company believes that it has valid and meritorious defenses against the allegations and because the classes have not yet been defined or certified by the court. On May 22, 2020, December 23, 2020 and October 29, 2021, we received civil investigative demands (“CIDs”) from the DOJ’s Civil Antitrust Division. The CIDs request information related to the fed cattle and beef packing markets. We have been cooperating with the DOJ with respect to the CIDs. The Offices of the Attorney General for multiple states are participating in the investigation and coordinating with the DOJ. We received a subpoena dated April 21, 2022 from the New York Attorney General’s Bureau of Consumer Frauds & Protection seeking information regarding our sales, prices and production costs of beef, pork and chicken products. After we had made an initial production of information, we were unable to agree with the New York Attorney General's office on the appropriate scope of the subpoena. Following initial litigation on the scope of the subpoena, we are reviewing and producing documents. Wage Rate Litigation On August 30, 2019, a putative class of non-supervisory production and maintenance employees at chicken processing plants in the continental United States filed class action complaints against us and certain of our subsidiaries, as well as several other poultry processing companies, in the United States District Court for the District of Maryland. The plaintiffs allege that the defendants directly and through a wage survey and benchmarking service exchanged information regarding labor rates in an effort to depress and fix the rates of wages for non-supervisory production and maintenance workers in violation of federal antitrust laws. The plaintiffs seek, among other things, treble monetary damages, punitive damages, restitution, and pre- and post-judgment interest, as well as declaratory and injunctive relief. Additional lawsuits making similar allegations were consolidated including an amended consolidated complaint containing additional allegations concerning turkey processing plants naming additional defendants. We moved to dismiss the amended consolidated complaint. On September 16, 2020, the court dismissed claims against us and certain other defendants without prejudice because the complaint improperly grouped together corporate subsidiaries. The court otherwise denied the defendants’ motions to dismiss and sustained claims based on alleged conspiracies to fix wages and exchange information against five other defendants. The plaintiffs filed a second amended consolidated complaint on November 2, 2020. We moved to dismiss the complaint on December 18, 2020 based on a lack of standing to assert claims on behalf of the purported class. The court denied the motion to dismiss on March 10, 2021. On February 16, 2022, the plaintiffs filed a third amended consolidated complaint naming additional poultry processors as defendants and expanding the scope of the claims to include employees at hatcheries and feed mills. We moved to dismiss the claims related to hatchery and feed mill employees. The court denied the motion to dismiss on July 19, 2022. In the third quarter of fiscal 2021, the Company recorded an accrual for the estimated probable losses that it expects to incur for this matter in the Company’s Consolidated Financial Statements. There was no change to the accrual in fiscal 2023 . The DOJ’s Antitrust Division has opened a civil investigation into human resources at several poultry companies. We are cooperating with the investigation. On November 11, 2022, a putative class of employees at beef-processing and pork-processing plants in the continental United States filed a class action complaint against us and certain of our subsidiaries, as well as several other beef-processing and pork-processing companies, in the United States District Court for the District of Colorado. The plaintiffs allege that the defendants directly and through a wage survey and benchmarking service exchanged information regarding labor rates in an effort to depress and fix the rates of wages for employees in violation of federal antitrust laws. The plaintiffs seek, among other things, treble monetary damages, punitive damages, restitution, and pre- and post-judgment interest, as well as declaratory and injunctive relief. On February 17, 2023, we moved to dismiss the complaint, and on September 27, 2023, the court denied our motion. The Company has not recorded any liability for this matter as it does not believe a loss is probable or reasonably estimable at this time because the Company believes that it has valid and meritorious defenses against the allegations and because the case remains at the pleading stage and the classes have not yet been defined or certified by the court. Other Matters Our subsidiary, The Hillshire Brands Company (formerly named Sara Lee Corporation), is a party to a consolidation of cases filed by individual complainants with the Republic of the Philippines, Department of Labor and Employment and the National Labor Relations Commission (“NLRC”) from 1998 through July 1999. The complaint was filed against Aris Philippines, Inc., Sara Lee Corporation, Sara Lee Philippines, Inc., Fashion Accessories Philippines, Inc., and Attorney Cesar C. Cruz (collectively, the “respondents”). The complaint alleges, among other things, that the respondents engaged in unfair labor practices in connection with the termination of manufacturing operations in the Philippines in 1995 by Aris Philippines, Inc., a former subsidiary of The Hillshire Brands Company. In late 2004, a labor arbiter ruled against the respondents and awarded the complainants approximately $ 61 million in damages and fees. From 2004 through 2014, the parties filed numerous appeals, motions for reconsideration and petitions for review, certain of which remained outstanding for several years. On December 15, 2016, we learned that the NLRC rendered its decision on November 29, 2016, regarding the respondents’ appeals from the labor arbiter’s 2004 ruling in favor of the complainants. The NLRC increased the award for 4,922 of the total 5,984 complainants to approximately $ 262 million. However, the NLRC approved a prior settlement reached with the group comprising approximately 18 % of the class of 5,984 complainants, pursuant to which The Hillshire Brands Company agreed to pay each settling complainant approximately $ 1,200 . The parties filed numerous appeals, motions for reconsideration and petitions for review related to the NLRC award and settlement payment. The Court of Appeals subsequently vacated the NLRC’s award on April 12, 2018. Complainants have filed motions for reconsideration with the Court of Appeals which were denied. Claimants have since filed petitions for writ of certiorari with the Supreme Court of the Philippines, which has accepted. The Company continues to maintain an accrual for estimated probable losses for this matter in the Company’s Consolidated Financial Statements. Various claims have been asserted against the Company, its subsidiaries, and its officers and agents by, and on behalf of, team members who claim to have contracted COVID-19 in our facilities. The Company has not recorded any liability for these matters as it does not believe a loss is probable or reasonably estimable at this time because it believes the allegations in the claims are without merit. Report of Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm To the Board of Directors and Shareholders of Tyson Foods, Inc. Opinions on the Financial Statements and Internal Control over Financial Reporting We have audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheets of Tyson Foods, Inc. and its subsidiaries (the “Company”) as of September 30, 2023 and October 1, 2022, and the related consolidated statements of income, of comprehensive income, of shareholders' equity and of cash flows for the fiscal years ended September 30, 2023, October 1, 2022 and October 2, 2021, including the related notes and the schedule of valuation and qualifying accounts for the fiscal years ended September 30, 2023, October 1, 2022 and October 2, 2021 appearing under Item 15 (collectively referred to as the “consolidated financial statements”). We also have audited the Company's internal control over financial reporting as of September 30, 2023, based on criteria established in Internal Control - Integrated Framework (2013) issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (COSO). In our opinion, the consolidated financial statements referred to above present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of the Company as of September 30, 2023 and October 1, 2022, and the results of its operations and its cash flows for the fiscal years ended September 30, 2023, October 1, 2022 and October 2, 2021 in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America. Also in our opinion, the Company maintained, in all material respects, effective internal control over financial reporting as of September 30, 2023, based on criteria established in Internal Control - Integrated Framework (2013) issued by the COSO. Basis for Opinions The Company's management is responsible for these consolidated financial statements, for maintaining effective internal control over financial reporting, and for its assessment of the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting, included in Management’s Annual Report on Internal Control Over Financial Reporting appearing under Item 9A. Our responsibility is to express opinions on the Company’s consolidated financial statements and on the Company's internal control over financial reporting based on our audits. We are a public accounting firm registered with the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States) (PCAOB) and are required to be independent with respect to the Company in accordance with the U.S. federal securities laws and the applicable rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB. We conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audits to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the consolidated financial statements are free of material misstatement, whether due to error or fraud, and whether effective internal control over financial reporting was maintained in all material respects. Our audits of the consolidated financial statements included performing procedures to assess the risks of material misstatement of the consolidated financial statements, whether due to error or fraud, and performing procedures that respond to those risks. Such procedures included examining, on a test basis, evidence regarding the amounts and disclosures in the consolidated financial statements. Our audits also included evaluating the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall presentation of the consolidated financial statements. Our audit of internal control over financial reporting included obtaining an understanding of internal control over financial reporting, assessing the risk that a material weakness exists, and testing and evaluating the design and operating effectiveness of internal control based on the assessed risk. Our audits also included performing such other procedures as we considered necessary in the circumstances. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinions. Definition and Limitations of Internal Control over Financial Reporting \", 'A company’s internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. A company’s internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that (i) pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company; (ii) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the company; and (iii) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the company’s assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements. ', 'Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate. Critical Audit Matters The critical audit matter communicated below is a matter arising from the current period audit of the consolidated financial statements that was communicated or required to be communicated to the audit committee and that (i) relates to accounts or disclosures that are material to the consolidated financial statements and (ii) involved our especially challenging, subjective, or complex judgments. The communication of critical audit matters does not alter in any way our opinion on the consolidated financial statements, taken as a whole, and we are not, by communicating the critical audit matter below, providing a separate opinion on the critical audit matter or on the accounts or disclosures to which it relates. Third and Fourth Quarter Interim Goodwill Impairment Assessments – Certain Reporting Units in the Chicken, Beef and Pork Segments and in International/Other As described in Notes 1 and 5 to the consolidated financial statements, the Company’s consolidated goodwill balance was $9,878 million as of September 30, 2023, which included $3,064 million, $343 million, $423 million and $144 million for reporting units in the Chicken, Beef and Pork segments and in International/Other, respectively. Goodwill is reviewed for impairment at least annually or more frequently if impairment indicators arise. If it is determined, based on qualitative factors, the fair value of the reporting unit may more likely than not be less than carrying amount, a quantitative goodwill impairment test is performed. Management estimates the fair value of reporting units considering the use of various valuation techniques, with the primary technique being an income approach (discounted cash flow method) and another technique being a market approach (guideline public company method). The determination of fair value using these techniques includes assumptions about sales growth, operating margins, discount rates and valuation multiples which consider budgets, business plans, economic projections and marketplace data. During the third quarter of fiscal 2023, the Company experienced lower than anticipated operating results and changing market fundamentals, as well as a drop in its market capitalization to below book value. Consequently, management performed an interim assessment of goodwill and recorded a $448 million goodwill impairment charge, of which $210 million and $238 million was recognized in the Chicken segment and International/Other, respectively. Management performed its annual impairment test as of the first day of the fourth quarter in fiscal 2023, and it did not result in an additional goodwill impairment. During the fourth quarter of fiscal 2023, long-term treasury rates increased, which caused an increase in the discount rates used in estimating the fair value of the reporting units. Consequently, management determined it was necessary to perform a quantitative assessment for the Beef, Pork and two of the Chicken segment reporting units as of September 30, 2023, and management recognized a $333 million goodwill impairment charge related to the Beef reporting unit. The principal considerations for our determination that performing procedures relating to the third and fourth quarter interim goodwill impairment assessments of certain reporting units in the Chicken, Beef and Pork segments and in International/Other is a critical audit matter are (i) the significant judgment by management when developing the fair value estimates of the reporting units; (ii) a high degree of auditor judgment, subjectivity and effort in performing procedures and evaluating management’s significant assumptions related to (a) for the third quarter interim impairment assessment: sales growth, operating margins, and discount rates used in the discounted cash flow method for the Beef, Pork and certain Chicken and International/Other reporting units, and valuation multiples used in the guideline public company method for certain Chicken and International/Other reporting units and (b) for the fourth quarter interim impairment assessment: operating margins and discount rates used in the discounted cash flow method for the Beef reporting unit; and (iii) the audit effort involved the use of professionals with specialized skill and knowledge. Addressing the matter involved performing procedures and evaluating audit evidence in connection with forming our overall opinion on the consolidated financial statements. These procedures included testing the effectiveness of the Company’s controls relating to management’s third and fourth quarter interim goodwill impairment assessments, including controls over the valuation of certain reporting units in the Chicken, Beef and Pork segments and in International/Other. These procedures also included, among others, as applicable to the reporting units and interim impairment assessments described above, (i) testing management’s process for developing the fair value estimates of certain reporting units in the Chicken, Beef and Pork segments and in International/Other; (ii) evaluating the appropriateness of the income and market valuation approaches, as applicable; (iii) testing the completeness and accuracy of underlying data used in the valuation approaches; and (iv) evaluating the reasonableness of management’s significant assumptions related to sales growth, operating margins, discount rates and valuation multiples, as applicable. Evaluating management’s assumptions related to sales growth, operating margins, discount rates and valuation multiples involved evaluating whether the assumptions used were reasonable considering (i) the current and past performance of the reporting units; (ii) the consistency with external market and industry data; and (iii) whether the assumptions were consistent with evidence obtained in other areas of the audit. Professionals with specialized skill and knowledge were used to assist in evaluating (i) the appropriateness of the Company’s valuation approaches and (ii) the reasonableness of the sales growth, discount rates and valuation multiples significant assumptions, as applicable to the reporting units and interim impairment assessments described above. /s/ PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP Springdale, Arkansas November 13, 2023 We have served as the Company’s auditor since 2009.

       "{'Risks Related to Regulation and Litigation ': 'We could be subject to adverse publicity or claims from consumers. Certain of our products contain ingredients which are the subject of public scrutiny, including the suggestion that consumption may have adverse health effects. Although we strive to respond to consumer preferences and social expectations, we may not be successful in these efforts. An unfavorable report on the effects of ingredients present in our products, product recalls, such as the Jif peanut butter product recall, or negative publicity or litigation could influence consumer preferences, significantly reduce the demand for our products, and adversely affect our profitability. We may also be subject to complaints from or litigation by consumers who allege food and beverage-related illness, or other quality, health, or operational concerns. Adverse publicity resulting from such allegations could materially adversely affect us, regardless of whether such allegations are true or whether we are ultimately held liable. A lawsuit or claim could result in an adverse decision against us, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, and results of operations. Changes in tax, environmental, or other regulations and laws, or their application, or failure to comply with existing licensing, trade, and other regulations and laws could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition. We are subject to income and other taxes, primarily in the U.S. and Canada, based upon the jurisdictions in which our sales and profits are determined to be earned and taxed. Federal, state, and foreign statutory income tax rates and taxing regimes have been subject to significant change and continue to evolve. Our interpretation of current tax laws and their applicability to our business, as well as any changes to existing laws, can significantly impact our effective income tax rate and deferred tax balances. In particular, proposals brought forth by the U.S. presidential administration include increases to federal income tax rates that, if enacted, could have a material impact to our financial results. We are also subject to regular reviews, examinations, and audits by the Internal Revenue Service (the “IRS”) and other taxing authorities with respect to taxes within and outside of the U.S. Although we believe our tax estimates are reasonable, the final outcome of tax controversies could result in material incremental tax liabilities, including interest and penalties. Our effective income tax rate is also influenced by the geography, timing, nature, and magnitude of transactions, such as acquisitions and divestitures, restructuring activities, and impairment charges. Further, we continue to monitor The Inflation Reduction Act of 2022, H.R. 5376 (the “Inflation Reduction Act”) and related regulatory developments to evaluate their potential impact on our business, tax rate, and financial results. Our operations are subject to various regulations and laws, in addition to tax laws, administered by federal, state, and local government agencies in the U.S., including the FDA, U.S. Federal Trade Commission, the U.S. Departments of Agriculture, Commerce, and Labor, state regulatory agencies, and other agencies, as well as to regulations and laws administered by government agencies in Canada and other countries in which we have operations and our products are sold. In particular, the manufacturing, marketing, transportation, storage, distribution, and sale of food products are each subject to governmental regulation that is increasingly extensive. Governmental regulation encompasses such matters as ingredients (including whether a product contains bioengineered ingredients), packaging, labeling, pricing, advertising, relations with distributors and retailers, health, safety, data privacy and security, and anti-corruption, as well as an increased focus regarding environmental policies relating to climate change, regulating greenhouse gas emissions, energy policies, and sustainability, including single-use plastics. Additionally, we are routinely subject to new or modified securities regulations, other laws and regulations, and accounting and reporting standards. In the U.S., we are required to comply with federal laws, such as the Food, Drug and Cosmetic Act, the Food Safety Modernization Act, the Occupational Safety and Health Act, the Clean Air Act, the Clean Water Act, the Resource Conservation and Recovery Act, the Tariff Act, laws governing equal employment opportunity, and various other federal statutes and regulations. We are also subject to various laws and regulations that are continuously evolving in the U.S. and other jurisdictions regarding privacy, data protection, and data security, including those related to the collection, storage, handling, use, disclosure, transfer, and security of personal data. For example, in the U.S., the California Consumer Privacy Act (the “CCPA”) imposes requirements on companies that do business in California and collect personal information from certain individuals, providing civil penalties for companies that fail to comply with these requirements as well as a private right of action for data breaches. Further, the California Privacy Rights Act, which took effect January 1, 2023, builds on the CCPA requiring the establishment of a dedicated agency to regulate privacy issues. Similarly, Virginia, Colorado, Connecticut, and Utah have all adopted laws that take effect in calendar year 2023, introducing new privacy obligations that will require developing additional compliance mechanisms and processes. There also is a wide range of enforcement agencies at both state and federal levels that can review companies for privacy and data security concerns based on general consumer protection laws. Accordingly, failure to comply with federal and state laws regarding privacy and security of personal information could expose us to fines and penalties under such laws. Complying with new regulations and laws, or changes to existing regulations and laws, or their application could increase our costs or adversely affect our sales of certain products. In addition, our failure or inability to comply with applicable regulations and laws could subject us to civil remedies, including fines, injunctions, recalls or seizures, and potential criminal sanctions, which could have a material adverse effect on our business and financial condition. Our operations in certain developing markets expose us to regulatory risks. In many countries outside of the U.S., particularly in those with developing economies, it may be common for others to engage in business practices prohibited by laws and regulations applicable to us, such as the U.S. Foreign Corrupt Practices Act or similar local anti-bribery or anti-corruption laws. These laws generally prohibit companies and their employees, contractors, or agents from making improper payments to government officials for the purpose of obtaining or retaining business. Failure to comply with these laws could subject us to civil and criminal penalties that could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations. In addition, the enforcement of remedies in foreign jurisdictions may be less certain, resulting in varying abilities to enforce intellectual property and contractual rights. Risks associated with climate change and other environmental impacts or legal, regulatory, or market measures to address climate change may negatively affect our business and operations. As set forth in the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change Sixth Assessment Report, global average temperatures are gradually increasing due to increased concentration of carbon dioxide and other greenhouse gases in the atmosphere, which have contributed to and are expected to continue contributing to significant changes in weather patterns around the globe and an increase in the frequency and severity of extreme weather and natural disasters. In the event that climate change has a negative effect on agricultural productivity, we may be subject to decreased availability or less favorable pricing for certain commodities that are necessary for our products, such as green coffee, protein meals, peanuts, grains, plastic containers, oils and fats, fruit, and other ingredients. We may also be subjected to decreased availability or less favorable pricing for water or energy as a result of such change, which could impact our manufacturing and distribution operations. In addition, natural disasters and extreme weather conditions may disrupt the productivity of our facilities or the operation of our supply chain, which could increase our insurance or other operating costs or require us to make additional, unplanned capital expenditures. Specifically, in 2022, Hurricane Ida caused our coffee manufacturing facilities in New Orleans, Louisiana to be temporarily shut down, and in 2021, unforeseen weather events in Texas, Oklahoma, and Kansas temporarily shut down our pet manufacturing facilities in Kansas. Although we consider these to be uncommon events and we were able to effectively minimize any disruptions through our business continuity planning efforts, extreme weather could disrupt our production in the future, adversely affecting our ability to meet customer deadlines and supply demands. Additionally, there is an increased focus by foreign, federal, state, and local regulatory and legislative bodies regarding environmental policies relating to climate change, regulating greenhouse gas emissions, energy policies, and sustainability, including single-use plastics. Increased energy or compliance costs and expenses due to the impacts of climate change and additional legal or regulatory requirements regarding climate change designed to reduce or mitigate the effects of carbon dioxide and other greenhouse gas emissions on the environment could be costly and may cause disruptions in, or an increase in the costs associated with, our manufacturing and distribution facilities, as well as increase supply chain costs. Moreover, compliance with any such legal or regulatory requirements may require us to make significant changes to our business operations, strategy, and reporting, which will likely require substantial time, attention, and costs. Finally, we might fail to effectively address increased attention from the media, shareholders, activists, and other stakeholders on climate change and related environmental sustainability matters. Such failure, or the perception that we have failed to act responsibly with respect to such matters or to effectively respond to new or additional regulatory requirements regarding climate change, whether or not valid, could result in adverse publicity and negatively affect our business and reputation. In addition, from time to time we establish and publicly announce goals and commitments, including goals to reduce our impact on the environment. For example, in 2022, we established science-based targets for Scope 1, 2, and 3 greenhouse gas emissions. Our ability to achieve any stated goal, target, or objective is subject to numerous factors and conditions, many of which are outside of our control, including evolving regulatory requirements and the availability of suppliers that can meet our sustainability and other standards. Furthermore, standards for tracking and reporting such matters continue to evolve. Our selection of voluntary disclosure frameworks and standards, and the interpretation or application of those frameworks and standards, may change from time to time or differ from those of others. Methodologies for reporting this data may be updated and previously reported data may be adjusted to reflect improvement in availability and quality of third-party data, changing assumptions, changes in the nature and scope of our operations (including from acquisitions and divestitures), and other changes in circumstances, which could result in significant revisions to our current goals, reported progress in achieving such goals, or ability to achieve such goals in the future. If we fail to achieve, are perceived to have failed, or are delayed in achieving these goals and commitments, it could negatively affect consumer preference for our products or investor confidence in our stock, as well as expose us to government enforcement actions and private litigation. The physical effects and transitional costs of climate change and legal, regulatory, or market initiatives to address climate change could have a negative impact on our business, financial condition, and results of operations. General Risk Factors We may be unable to grow market share of our products. We operate in the competitive food industry whose growth potential is positively correlated to population growth. Our success depends in part on our ability to grow our brands faster than the population in general. We consider our ability to build and sustain the equity of our brands critical to our market share growth. If we do not succeed in these efforts, our market share growth may slow, which could have a material impact on our results of operations.  If our information technology systems fail to perform adequately or we are unable to protect such information technology systems against data corruption, cyber-based attacks, or network security breaches, our operations could be disrupted, and we may suffer financial damage or loss because of lost or misappropriated information. We rely on information technology networks and systems, including the Internet, to process, transmit, and store electronic information, and the importance of such networks and systems has increased due to many of our employees working remotely. In particular, we depend on our information technology infrastructure to effectively manage our business data, supply chain, logistics, finance, manufacturing, and other business processes and for digital marketing activities and electronic communications between Company personnel and our customers and suppliers. If we do not allocate and effectively manage the resources necessary to build, sustain, and protect an appropriate technology infrastructure, or we do not effectively implement system upgrades, our business or financial results could be negatively impacted. We are regularly the target of attempted cyber and other security threats. Therefore, we continuously monitor and update our information technology networks and infrastructure to prevent, detect, address, and mitigate the risk of unauthorized access, misuse, computer viruses, phishing attacks, malware, ransomware, social engineering, password theft, physical breaches, and other events that could have a security impact. In addition, the ongoing conflict between Russia and Ukraine has heightened the risk of cyberattacks. We invest in industry standard security technology to protect our data and business processes against the risk of data security breaches and cyber-based attacks. We believe our security technology tools and processes provide adequate measures of protection against security breaches and in reducing cybersecurity risks. Nevertheless, despite continued vigilance in these areas, security breaches or system failures of our infrastructure, whether due to attacks by hackers, employee error, or other causes, can create system disruptions, shutdowns, transaction errors, or unauthorized disclosure of confidential information. If we are unable to prevent such breaches or failures, our operations could be disrupted, or we may suffer financial damage or loss because of lost or misappropriated information. In addition, the cost to remediate any damages to our information technology systems suffered as a result of a cyber-based attack could be significant. Further, we have outsourced several information technology support services and administrative functions, including benefit plan administration and other functions, to third-party service providers, and may outsource other functions in the future to achieve cost savings and efficiencies. In addition, certain of our processes rely on third-party cloud computing services. If the service providers to which we outsource these functions do not perform effectively, we may not be able to achieve the expected benefits and may have to incur additional costs to correct errors made by such service providers. Depending on the function involved, such errors may also lead to business disruption, processing inefficiencies, inaccurate financial reporting, the loss of or damage to intellectual property through security breach, the loss of sensitive data through security breach, or otherwise. We may face complications with the design or implementation of our new enterprise performance management system, which may negatively affect our business and operations. We rely on information technology networks and systems to manage our business and operations. We are in the process of a multi-year implementation of a new enterprise performance management (“EPM”) system, inclusive of an enterprise resource planning system (i.e., general ledger), through the use of Oracle Cloud Solutions. The EPM system will replace our existing financial system and is designed to accurately maintain our financial records, enhance operational functionality and efficiency, and provide timely information to our management team. The EPM system implementation process has required, and will continue to require, the investment of significant personnel and financial resources over the duration of the project. We anticipate full integration of the EPM system by the end of 2025. Further, we may not be able to successfully implement the EPM system without experiencing delays, increased costs, and other complications. If we are unable to successfully design and implement the new EPM system as planned, our financial condition, results of operations, and cash flows could be negatively impacted. In addition, if the EPM system does not operate as intended, the effectiveness of our internal controls over financial reporting could be negatively affected. The ongoing conflict between Russia and Ukraine and the related disruptions to the global economy could adversely affect our business, financial condition, or results of operations. The global economy has been negatively impacted by the ongoing conflict between Russia and Ukraine. Governments in the United States, United Kingdom, and European Union have imposed sanctions on certain products, industry sectors, and parties in Russia. Although we do not have any operations in Russia or Ukraine, we have experienced and may continue to experience shortages in materials and increased costs for transportation, energy, and raw materials due in part to the negative impact of the conflict on the global economy. If the conflict continues for an extended period of time, it could result in cyberattacks, supply chain disruptions, lower consumer demand, changes in foreign exchange rates, increased trade barriers and restrictions on global trade, and other impacts, which may adversely affect our business, financial condition, or results of operations. These and other impacts of the ongoing conflict between Russia and Ukraine could also heighten many of the other risk factors discussed in this section. '}"

A company’s internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that (1) pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company; (2) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the company; and (3) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the company’s assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements.

M. Smucker Company Opinion on the Financial Statements We have audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheets of The J. M. Smucker Company (the “Company”) as of April 30, 2023 and 2022, the related statements of consolidated income, comprehensive income, shareholders’ equity, and cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended April 30, 2023, and the related notes (collectively referred to as the “consolidated financial statements”). In our opinion, the consolidated financial statements present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of the Company at April 30, 2023 and 2022, and the results of its operations and its cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended April 30, 2023, in conformity with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles. We also have audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States) (“PCAOB”), the Company’s internal control over financial reporting as of April 30, 2023, based on criteria established in Internal Control – Integrated Framework issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (2013 framework), and our report dated June 20, 2023 expressed an unqualified opinion thereon. Basis for Opinion These financial statements are the responsibility of the Company’s management. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the Company’s financial statements based on our audits. We are a public accounting firm registered with the PCAOB and are required to be independent with respect to the Company in accordance with the U.S. federal securities laws and the applicable rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB. We conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material misstatement, whether due to error or fraud. Our audits included performing procedures to assess the risks of material misstatement of the financial statements, whether due to error or fraud, and performing procedures that respond to those risks. Such procedures included examining, on a test basis, evidence regarding the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements. Our audits also included evaluating the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall presentation of the financial statements. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion. Critical Audit Matters The critical audit matters communicated below are matters arising from the current period audit of the financial statements that were communicated or required to be communicated to the audit committee and that: (1) relate to accounts or disclosures that are material to the financial statements and (2) involved our especially challenging, subjective, or complex judgments. The communication of critical audit matters does not alter in any way our opinion on the consolidated financial statements, taken as a whole, and we are not, by communicating the critical audit matters below, providing separate opinions on the critical audit matters or on the accounts or disclosures to which they relate. U.S. Retail Pet Foods Goodwill Impairment Evaluation  Description of the Matter ', 'At April 30, 2023, the Company’s total goodwill was $5.2 billion, of that, $1.6 billion relates to the U.S. Retail Pet Foods segment. Goodwill is assigned to the Company’s reporting units as of the acquisition date. As discussed in Note 1 and Note 6 of the consolidated financial statements, goodwill is quantitatively tested at the reporting unit level for impairment at least annually on February 1, or when events or circumstances occur that would more likely than not reduce the fair value of a reporting unit below its carrying amount. The Company uses an income and market approach in its quantitative impairment tests. U.S. Retail Pet Foods goodwill is susceptible to impairment due to the narrow difference between fair value and carrying value. ', 'Auditing the Company’s annual U.S. Retail Pet Foods goodwill impairment evaluation was complex and highly judgmental due to the significant estimation required in determining the fair value of the reporting unit. In particular, the fair value estimate using the income approach was sensitive to significant assumptions such as the weighted average cost of capital, discrete revenue growth rates, terminal period revenue growth rate, and profitability assumptions. Elements of these significant assumptions are forward-looking and could be affected by future economic conditions and/or changes in consumer preferences.  How We Addressed the Matter in Our Audit We obtained an understanding, evaluated the design and tested the operating effectiveness of controls over the Company’s U.S. Retail Pet Foods goodwill impairment review process, including controls over the significant assumptions mentioned above. To test the estimated fair value used in the Company’s U.S. Retail Pet Foods impairment analysis, we performed audit procedures that included, among others, assessing fair value methodologies and testing the significant assumptions discussed above and the underlying data used by the Company in its analysis. As it pertains to revenue growth rates and profitability assumptions, we compared the significant assumptions used by management to current industry and economic trends, changes to the Company’s business model, customer base or product mix, as applicable. We assessed the historical accuracy of management’s estimates. In addition, we involved our valuation specialists to assist with our evaluation of the methodology used by the Company and significant assumptions, including, the weighted average cost of capital. Specifically, we evaluated the components of the weighted average cost of capital assumptions used by the Company by performing an independent corroborative calculation with the involvement of our valuation specialists. Allocation of Goodwill Related to the Divestiture of Certain Pet Food Brands  Description of the Matter As discussed in Note 3 and Note 6 to the consolidated financial statements, on April 28, 2023, the Company divested certain pet food brands. In conjunction with the divestiture, management allocated goodwill previously included primarily in the U.S. Retail Pet Foods segment to the pet food brands disposal group using a relative fair value approach. Goodwill of $790.3 million was allocated to the pet food brands disposal group as part of the divestiture. Auditing the Company’s allocation of goodwill to the pet food brands disposal group was complex due to the significant estimation required to determine the relative fair values of the U.S. Retail Pet Foods segment and the pet food brands disposal group referred to above. These fair value estimates were sensitive to significant assumptions such as the weighted-average cost of capital, discrete revenue growth rates, terminal period revenue growth rate, and profitability assumptions. Elements of these significant assumptions are forward-looking and could be affected by future economic conditions and/or changes in consumer preferences.  How We Addressed the Matter in Our Audit We obtained an understanding, evaluated the design and tested the operating effectiveness of management’s controls over the goodwill allocation process. For example, we tested controls over management’s review of the significant assumptions described above along with the completeness and accuracy of the data used in these fair value estimates. To test the estimated fair value of the goodwill allocated to the divested pet food brands, we performed audit procedures that included, among others, assessing fair value methodologies and testing the significant assumptions discussed above and the underlying data used by the Company in its analysis. As it pertains to revenue growth rates and profitability assumptions, we compared the significant assumptions used by management to current industry and economic trends. We assessed the historical accuracy of management’s estimates and performed sensitivity analyses of significant assumptions to evaluate any hypothetical change in the fair value of the U.S. Retail Pet Foods segment and pet food brands disposal group that would result from changes in significant assumptions. In addition, we involved our valuation specialists to assist with our evaluation of the methodology used by the Company and significant assumptions, including, the weighted average cost of capital. Specifically, we evaluated the components of the weighted average cost of capital assumptions used by the Company by performing an independent corroborative calculation with the involvement of our valuation specialists. We also tested the allocation of goodwill by recalculating the amounts based on the estimated fair values of the U.S. Retail Pet Foods segment and the pet food brands disposal group. Furthermore, we have evaluated the Company’s disclosures in relation to the allocation of goodwill. /s/ Ernst & Young LLP We have served as the Company’s auditor since 1955. Akron, Ohio June 20, 2023 REPORT OF MANAGEMENT ON RESPONSIBILITY FOR FINANCIAL REPORTING Shareholders The J. M. Smucker Company Management of The J. M. Smucker Company is responsible for the preparation, integrity, accuracy, and consistency of the consolidated financial statements and the related financial information in this report. Such information has been prepared in accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles and is based on our best estimates and judgments. We maintain systems of internal accounting controls supported by formal policies and procedures that are communicated throughout the Company.

Ernst & Young LLP, an independent registered public accounting firm, has audited our financial statements in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States). Management has made all financial records and related data available to Ernst & Young LLP during its audit. Our audit committee, comprised of three independent non-employee members of the Board of Directors, meets regularly with the independent registered public accounting firm and management to review the work of the internal audit staff and the work, audit scope, timing arrangements, and fees of the independent registered public accounting firm.

It is our best judgment that our policies and procedures, our program of internal and independent audits, and the oversight activity of the audit committee work together to provide reasonable assurance that our operations are conducted according to law and in compliance with the high standards of business ethics and conduct to which we subscribe.

THE J. M. SMUCKER COMPANY NOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Dollars and shares in millions, unless otherwise noted, except per share data) Note 1: Accounting Policies Principles of Consolidation: The consolidated financial statements include the accounts of the Company, its wholly-owned subsidiaries, and its majority-owned investments, if any. Intercompany transactions and accounts are eliminated in consolidation. Use of Estimates: The preparation of consolidated financial statements in conformity with U.S. GAAP requires that we make certain estimates and assumptions that affect the amounts reported in the consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes. Estimates in these consolidated financial statements include, among others, estimates of future cash flows associated with assets, potential asset impairments, allocated goodwill disposed of as part of the sale of certain pet food brands, useful lives and residual values of long-lived assets used in determining depreciation and amortization, net realizable value of inventories, accruals for trade marketing and merchandising programs, income taxes, and discount rates and other assumptions used in determining defined benefit pension and other postretirement benefit expenses. Actual results could differ from these estimates. Cash and Cash Equivalents: We consider all short-term, highly-liquid investments with an original maturity of three months or less when purchased to be cash equivalents. Based on the short-term nature of these assets, carrying value approximates fair value. Cash equivalents within cash and cash equivalents in the Consolidated Balance Sheets were $ 614.0 and $ 116.3 at April 30, 2023 and 2022, respectively. Revenue Recognition: Most of our revenue is derived from the sale of food and beverage products to food retailers, online retailers, and foodservice distributors and operators. We recognize revenue when obligations under the terms of a contract with a customer have been satisfied. This occurs when control of our products transfers, which typically takes place upon delivery to or pick up by the customer. Amounts due from our customers are classified as trade receivables in the Consolidated Balance Sheets and require payment on a short-term basis. Transaction price is based on the list price included in our published price list, which is then reduced by the estimated impact of variable consideration, such as trade marketing and merchandising programs, discounts, unsaleable product allowances, returns, and similar items, in the same period that the revenue is recognized. To estimate the impact of these costs, we consider customer contract provisions, historical data, and our current expectations. We have trade marketing and merchandising programs that consist of various promotional activities conducted through retailers, distributors, or directly with consumers, including in-store display and product placement programs, price discounts, coupons, and other similar activities. For additional discussion on these programs, refer to “Critical Accounting Estimates and Policies” within Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations. For revenue disaggregated by reportable segment, geographical region, and product category, see Note 4: Reportable Segments. Shipping and Handling Costs: Transportation costs included in cost of products sold relate to the costs incurred to ship our products. Distribution costs are included in SD&A expenses and primarily relate to the warehousing costs incurred to store our products. Total distribution costs recorded within SD&A were $ 304.5 , $ 294.1 , and $ 281.8 in 2023, 2022, and 2021, respectively. Advertising Expense: Advertising costs are expensed as incurred. Advertising expense was $ 160.3 , $ 176.5 , and $ 224.4 in 2023, 2022, and 2021, respectively. Research and Development Costs: Research and development (“R&D”) costs are expensed as incurred and are included in SD&A in the Statements of Consolidated Income. R&D costs include expenditures for new and existing product and manufacturing process innovations, which are comprised primarily of internal salaries and wages, consulting, testing, and other supplies attributable to time spent on R&D activities. Other costs include the depreciation and maintenance of research facilities. Total R&D expense was $ 47.3 , $ 48.8 , and $ 57.7 in 2023, 2022, and 2021, respectively. Share-Based Payments: Share-based compensation expense, including stock options, is recognized on a straight-line basis over the requisite service period, and generally vest over a period of 1 to 3 years. The following table summarizes amounts related to share-based payments.   Year Ended April 30,  2023 2022 2021 Share-based compensation expense included in SD&A $ 25.6  $ 23.7  $ 28.3  Share-based compensation expense included in other special project costs —  ( 1.4 ) 0.4  Total share-based compensation expense $ 25.6  $ 22.3  $ 28.7  Related income tax benefit $ 6.0  $ 5.3  $ 6.6   As of April 30, 2023, total unrecognized share-based compensation cost related to nonvested share-based awards, including stock options, was $ 36.4 . The weighted-average period over which this amount is expected to be recognized is 1.9 years. Realized excess tax benefits and tax deficiencies are presented in the Statements of Consolidated Cash Flows as an operating activity and are recognized within income taxes in the Statements of Consolidated Income. In 2023 and 2022, the excess tax benefits realized upon exercise or vesting of share-based compensation were $ 1.4 and $ 1.1 , respectively, and in 2021, there were tax deficiencies realized of $ 0.1 . For additional discussion on share-based compensation expense, see Note 12: Share-Based Payments. Earnings Per Share: Earnings per share is computed in accordance with FASB ASC 260, Earnings Per Share . As required by ASC 260, we computed net income (loss) per common share (“basic earnings per share”) under the two-class method for 2023, 2022, and 2021, due to certain unvested common shares that contained non-forfeitable rights to dividends (i.e., participating securities) during the periods. Further, we compute net income (loss) per common share – assuming dilution (“diluted earnings per share”) under either the two-class method or the treasury method, dependent on which is more dilutive. In 2023, we recognized a net loss, and as a result, excluded the anti-dilutive effect of stock-based awards from the computation of net income (loss) per common share – assuming dilution. Therefore, in 2023, diluted earnings per share was computed under the two-class method. In 2022, the computation of diluted earnings per share was more dilutive under the treasury stock method, while in 2021, diluted earnings per share was more dilutive under the two-class method. Basic earnings per share is calculated by dividing net income (loss) available to common shareholders by the weighted-average number of common shares outstanding during the period. Under the two-class method, net income (loss) available to common and participating common shareholders is reduced by the net income (loss) allocated to participating securities, which is equal to the amount of dividends declared in the current period and by the contractual amount of dividends that must be paid for the current period related to participating securities. Under the treasury stock method, the diluted earnings per share calculation includes potential common shares assumed to be issued, which reflects the potential dilution that would occur if any outstanding options or warrants were exercised or restricted stock becomes vested, and includes the “if converted” method for participating securities if the effect is dilutive. For additional information on the earnings per share calculations, see Note 5: Earnings Per Share. Defined Contribution Plans: We offer employee savings plans for domestic and Canadian employees. Our contributions under these plans are based on a specified percentage of employee contributions. Charges to operations for these plans in 2023, 2022, and 2021 were $ 41.0 , $ 40.9 , and $ 41.2 , respectively. For information on our defined benefit plans, see Note 8: Pensions and Other Postretirement Benefits. Income Taxes: We account for income taxes using the liability method. Accordingly, deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized for the future tax consequences attributable to differences between financial statement carrying amounts of existing assets and liabilities and their respective tax bases. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured using enacted income tax rates expected to apply to taxable income in the years in which those temporary differences are expected to be recovered or settled. The effect on deferred tax assets and liabilities of a change in the applicable tax rate is recognized in income or expense in the period that the change is enacted. A tax benefit is recognized when it is more likely than not to be sustained. A valuation allowance is established when it is more likely than not that all or a portion of a deferred tax asset will not be realized. We account for the financial statement recognition and measurement criteria of a tax position taken or expected to be taken in a tax return under FASB ASC 740, Income Taxes . ASC 740 also provides guidance on derecognition, classification, interest and penalties, accounting in interim periods, and disclosure. In accordance with the requirements of ASC 740, uncertain tax positions have been classified in the Consolidated Balance Sheets as noncurrent, except to the extent payment is expected within one year. We recognize net interest and penalties related to unrecognized tax benefits in income tax expense. Trade Receivables: In the normal course of business, we extend credit to customers. Trade receivables, less credit losses, reflects the net realizable value of receivables and approximates fair value. We account for trade receivables, less credit losses, under Accounting Standards Update (“ASU”) 2016-13, Financial Instruments – Credit Losses . We evaluate our trade receivables and establish a reserve for credit loss based on a combination of factors. When aware that a specific customer has been impacted by circumstances such as bankruptcy filings or deterioration in the customer’s operating results or financial position, potentially making it unable to meet its financial obligations, we record a specific reserve for bad debt to reduce the related receivable to the amount we reasonably believe is collectible. We also record reserves for credit loss for all other customers based on a variety of factors, including the length of time the receivables are past due, historical collection experience, and an evaluation of current and projected economic conditions at the balance sheet date. Trade receivables are charged off against the reserve for credit losses after we determine that the potential for recovery is remote. At April 30, 2023 and 2022, the reserve for credit loss was $ 2.3 . We believe there is no concentration of risk with any single customer whose failure or nonperformance would materially affect results other than as discussed in Note 4: Reportable Segments. Inventories: Inventories are stated at the lower of cost or market, with market being defined as net realizable value, less costs to sell. Cost for all inventories is determined using the first-in, first-out method applied on a consistent basis. The cost of finished products and work-in-process inventory includes materials, direct labor, and overhead. Work-in-process is included in finished products in the Consolidated Balance Sheets and was $ 82.5 and $ 65.8 at April 30, 2023 and 2022, respectively. Derivative Financial Instruments: We account for derivative instruments in accordance with FASB ASC 815, Derivatives and Hedging , which requires all derivative instruments to be recognized at fair value in the financial statements, regardless of the purpose or intent for holding them. We do not qualify commodity derivatives or instruments used to manage foreign currency exchange exposures for hedge accounting treatment, and, as a result, the derivative gains and losses are immediately recognized in earnings. Although we do not perform the assessments required to achieve hedge accounting for derivative positions, we believe all of our derivatives are economic hedges of our risk exposure. The exposures hedged have a high inverse correlation to price changes of the derivative instrument. Thus, we would expect that over time any gain or loss in the estimated fair value of the derivatives would generally be offset by an increase or decrease in the estimated fair value of the underlying exposures. We utilize derivative instruments to manage interest rate risk associated with anticipated debt transactions, as well as to manage changes in the fair value of our long-term debt. At the inception of an interest rate contract, the instrument is evaluated and documented for qualifying hedge accounting treatment. If the contract is designated as a cash flow hedge, the mark-to-market gains or losses on the contract are deferred and included as a component of accumulated other comprehensive income (loss) and generally reclassified to interest expense in the period during which the hedged transaction affects earnings. If the contract is designated as a fair value hedge, the contract is recognized at fair value on the balance sheet, and changes in the fair value are recognized in interest expense. Generally, changes in the fair value of the contract are equal to changes in the fair value of the underlying debt and have no net impact on earnings. Property, Plant, and Equipment: Property, plant, and equipment is recognized at cost and is depreciated on a straight-line basis over the estimated useful life of the asset ( 3 to 20 years for machinery and equipment, 1 to 7 years for capitalized software costs related to software that we have purchased or has been licensed to us, and 5 to 40 years for buildings, fixtures, and improvements). We lease certain land, buildings, and equipment for varying periods of time, with renewal options. Lease expense in 2023, 2022, and 2021 totaled $ 113.3 , $ 111.0 , and $ 108.7 , respectively. In accordance with FASB ASC 360, Property, Plant, and Equipment , long-lived assets, other than goodwill and other indefinite-lived intangible assets, are reviewed for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value of an asset may not be recoverable. Recoverability of assets to be held and used is measured by a comparison of the carrying amount of the assets to future net undiscounted cash flows estimated to be generated by such assets. If such assets are considered to be impaired, the impairment to be recognized is the amount by which the carrying amount exceeds the estimated fair value of the assets. Assets to be disposed of by sale are recognized as held for sale at the lower of carrying value or fair value less costs to sell. Furthermore, determining fair value is subject to estimates of both cash flows and discount rates, and different estimates could yield different results. There are no events or changes in circumstances of which we are aware of that indicate the carrying value of our long-lived assets may not be recoverable at April 30, 2023. Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets: Goodwill is the excess of the purchase price paid over the estimated fair value of the net assets of a business acquired. In accordance with FASB ASC 350, Intangibles – Goodwill and Other, goodwill and other indefinite-lived intangible assets are not amortized but are reviewed at least annually for impairment. We conduct our annual test for impairment of goodwill and other indefinite-lived intangible assets as of February 1 of each year. A discounted cash flow valuation technique is utilized to estimate the fair value of our reporting units and indefinite-lived intangible assets. We also use a market-based approach to estimate the fair value of our reporting units. The discount rates utilized in the cash flow analyses are developed using a weighted-average cost of capital methodology. In addition to the annual test, we test for impairment if events or circumstances occur that would more likely than not reduce the fair value of a reporting unit or an indefinite-lived intangible asset below its carrying value. Further, upon disposal of a business, a relative fair value analysis is utilized to determine the amount of goodwill to be disposed of for each impacted reporting unit, using estimates and assumptions consistent with the annual test. Finite-lived intangible assets are amortized on a straight-line basis over their estimated useful lives. For additional information, see Note 6: Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets. Marketable Securities and Other Investments: We maintain funds for the payment of benefits associated with nonqualified retirement plans. These funds include investments considered to be available-for-sale marketable securities. At April 30, 2023 and 2022, the fair value of these investments was $ 24.0 and $ 26.6 , respectively, and was included in other noncurrent assets in the Consolidated Balance Sheets. Included in accumulated other comprehensive income (loss) at April 30, 2023 and 2022, were unrealized pre-tax gains of $ 1.8 and $ 2.4 , respectively. Investment in Equity Securities: Investments in common stock of entities other than our consolidated subsidiaries in which we own less than 20 percent of an entity’s common stock and do not provide significant influence are accounted for as a financial instrument in accordance with FASB ASC 321, Investments – Equity Securities. As required by ASC 321, the ownership interest in the entity is recognized at fair value based on fixed or determinable prices within current assets in the Consolidated Balance Sheets, and any change in fair value is included in other income (expense) – net in the Statements of Consolidated Income. ', 'The net proceeds received from the divestiture of certain pet food brands included approximately 5.4 million shares of Post common stock, which represents approximately an 8 percent equity interest in Post. At April 30, 2023, the fair value of the investment in Post common stock was $ 487.8 , which included an unrealized pre-tax loss of $ 3.8 . In connection with the divestiture of certain pet food brands and the acquisition of Post common stock, we entered into a registration rights agreement with Post (the “Registration Rights Agreement”) on April 28, 2023. Under the Registration Rights Agreement, Post must use reasonable best efforts to keep its existing registration statement on Form S-3, or any applicable subsequent shelf registration statement, continuously effective and usable for the resale of the Post common stock that we received in the divestiture, and upon receipt of a request or notice from us, Post must, subject to the terms and conditions of the Registration Rights Agreement, register the sale of the Post common stock under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended. In May 2023, we entered into an agreement with an unrelated third party giving us the ability to enter into forward derivative transactions to provide flexibility with respect to the potential sale of Post common stock during the first two quarters of 2024. Subsequent to April 30, 2023, we have not entered into any forward derivative transactions. ', \"Equity Method Investments: Investments in common stock of entities other than our consolidated subsidiaries in which we own between 20 percent and 50 percent of an entity’s common stock and are able to exercise significant influence over them are accounted for under the equity method in accordance with FASB ASC 323, Investments – Equity Method and Joint Ventures . Under the equity method, the initial investment is recorded at cost, and the investment is subsequently adjusted for its proportionate share of earnings or losses, including consideration of basis differences resulting from the difference between the initial carrying amount of the investment and the underlying equity in net assets. The difference between the carrying amount of the investment and the underlying equity in net assets is primarily attributable to goodwill and other intangible assets. We have a 20 percent equity interest in Mountain Country Foods, LLC, and approximately a 42 percent equity interest in Numi, Inc. The carrying amount of these investments is included in other noncurrent assets in the Consolidated Balance Sheets. The investments did not have a material impact on the consolidated financial statements or the respective reportable segment to which they relate for the years ended April 30, 2023 and 2022. Supplier Financing Program: We have an agreement with a third-party administrator to provide an accounts payable tracking system and facilitate a supplier financing program which allows participating suppliers the ability to monitor and voluntarily elect to sell our payment obligations to a designated third-party financial institution. Participating suppliers can sell one or more of our payment obligations at their sole discretion, and our rights and obligations to our suppliers are not impacted. We have no economic interest in a supplier’s decision to enter into these agreements. Our obligations to our suppliers, including amounts due and scheduled payment terms, are not impacted by our suppliers’ decisions to sell amounts under these arrangements. However, our right to offset balances due from suppliers against our payment obligations is restricted by the agreement for those payment obligations that have been sold by our suppliers. The payment of these obligations is included in cash provided by operating activities in the Statements of Consolidated Cash Flows. Included in accounts payable in the Consolidated Balance Sheets as of April 30, 2023 and 2022, were $ 414.2 and $ 314.3 of our outstanding payment obligations, respectively, that were elected and sold to a financial institution by participating suppliers. Foreign Currency Translation: Assets and liabilities of foreign subsidiaries are translated using the exchange rates in effect at the balance sheet dates, while income and expenses are translated using average rates throughout the periods. Translation adjustments are reported as a component of accumulated other comprehensive income (loss). Included in accumulated other comprehensive income (loss) at April 30, 2023 and 2022, were foreign currency losses of $ 34.3 and $ 21.1 , respectively. Recently Issued Accounting Standards: In March 2022, the SEC issued the proposed rule under SEC Release No. 33-11042, The Enhancement and Standardization of Climate-Related Disclosures for Investors, to enhance and standardize the climate-related disclosures provided by public companies. This update will require the disclosure of greenhouse gas emissions, climate-related targets and goals, how the Board and management oversee climate-related risks, and Scope 1 and 2 emissions, which will be subject to third-party assurance. As of April 30, 2023, these amendments were not adopted by the SEC; however, we anticipate that the adoption of these amendments will have a material impact on our financial statements and disclosures. Risks and Uncertainties: The raw materials used in each of our segments are primarily commodities, agricultural-based products, and packaging materials. The principal packaging materials we use are plastic, glass, metal cans, caps, carton board, and corrugate. Green coffee, protein meals, peanuts, grains, oils and fats, fruit, and other ingredients are obtained from various suppliers. The availability, quality, and costs of many of these commodities have fluctuated, and may continue to fluctuate over time, partially driven by the elevated commodity and supply chain costs we experienced in 2023. We actively monitor changes in commodity and supply chain costs, and to mitigate the rising costs, we may be required to implement material price increases across our business. Green coffee, along with certain other raw materials, is sourced solely from foreign countries, and its supply and price is subject to high volatility due to factors such as weather, global supply and demand, product scarcity, plant disease, investor speculation, armed hostilities (including the ongoing conflict between Russia and Ukraine), changes in governmental agricultural and energy policies and regulation, and political and economic conditions in the source countries. Raw materials are generally available from numerous sources, although we have elected to source certain plastic packaging materials for our Folgers coffee products, as well as our Jif peanut butter, and certain finished goods, such as K-Cup ® pods, our Pup-Peroni dog snacks, and liquid coffee, from single sources of supply pursuant to long-term contracts. While availability may vary from year-to-year, we believe that we will continue to obtain adequate supplies and that alternatives to single-sourced materials are available. We have not historically encountered significant shortages of key raw materials. We consider our relationships with key raw material suppliers to be in good standing. We have consolidated production capacity at a single manufacturing site for certain products, including substantially all of our coffee, Milk-Bone dog snacks, and fruit spreads. Although steps are taken at all of our manufacturing sites to reduce the likelihood of a production disruption, an interruption at a single manufacturing site would result in a reduction or elimination of the availability of some of our products for a period of time. Of our full-time employees, 22 percent are covered by union contracts at seven manufacturing locations. The contracts vary in term depending on location, with one contract expiring in 2024, representing approximately one percent of our total employees. We insure our business and assets in each country against insurable risks, to the extent that we deem appropriate, based upon an analysis of the relative risks and costs. Note 2: Special Project Costs Special project costs primarily consist of employee-related costs and other transition and termination costs related to approved restructuring activities. Employee-related costs include severance, retention bonuses, and relocation costs. Severance costs and retention bonuses are recognized over the estimated future service period of the impacted employees, and relocation costs are expensed as incurred. Other transition and termination costs include fixed asset-related charges, contract and lease termination costs, professional fees, and other miscellaneous expenditures associated with the restructuring activities. With the exception of accelerated depreciation, these costs are expensed as incurred. These restructuring costs are reported in cost of products sold and other special project costs in the Statements of Consolidated Income and are not allocated to segment profit. The obligation related to employee separation costs is included in other current liabilities in the Consolidated Balance Sheets. A restructuring program was approved by the Board during 2021, associated with opportunities identified to reduce our overall cost structure, optimize our organizational design, and support our portfolio reshape. This is inclusive of certain restructuring costs associated with the divestitures of the Crisco, Natural Balance , private label dry pet food, and natural beverage and grains businesses. For additional information related to the divestitures, see Note 3: Divestitures. During 2021, we substantially completed an organizational redesign related to our corporate headquarters and announced plans to close our Suffolk, Virginia facility as a result of a new strategic partnership for the production of our liquid coffee products. During 2022, we completed the transition of production to JDE Peet’s, and expanded the restructuring program to include certain costs associated with the divestitures of the private label dry pet food and natural beverage and grains businesses, as well as the closure of our Ripon, Wisconsin production facility to further optimize operations for our U.S. Retail Consumer Foods business. We completed the closure of the Ripon facility during 2023, as planned, and the remaining restructuring activities were completed as of April 30, 2023. The costs incurred associated with these restructuring activities include other transition and termination costs associated with our cost reduction and margin management initiatives, inclusive of accelerated depreciation, as well as employee-related costs. The following table summarizes our restructuring costs incurred related to the restructuring program.   2023 2022 2021 Total Costs Incurred to Date at April 30, 2023 Employee-related costs $ 3.5  $ 6.3  $ 17.3  $ 27.1  Other transition and termination costs 7.6  22.2  6.8  36.6  Total restructuring costs $ 11.1  $ 28.5  $ 24.1  $ 63.7   The obligation related to severance costs and retention bonuses was $ 1.6 and $ 2.4 at April 30, 2023 and 2022, respectively, and is expected to be settled in the first quarter of 2024. As of April 30, 2023, cumulative noncash charges incurred to date were $ 33.2 , including $ 10.2 , $ 18.6 , and $ 4.4 incurred during 2023, 2022, and 2021, respectively, and primarily consisted of accelerated depreciation. Note 3: Divestitures On April 28, 2023, we sold certain pet food brands to Post. The transaction included the Rachael Ray Nutrish, 9Lives, Kibbles ’n Bits, Nature’s Recipe , and Gravy Train brands, as well as our private label pet food business, inclusive of certain trademarks and licensing agreements, manufacturing and distribution facilities in Bloomsburg, Pennsylvania, manufacturing facilities in Meadville, Pennsylvania and Lawrence, Kansas, and approximately 1,100 employees who supported these pet food brands. Under our ownership, these brands generated net sales of $ 1.5 billion in 2023, and $ 1.4 billion in both 2022 and 2021, primarily included in the U.S. Retail Pet Foods segment. Net proceeds from the divestiture were $ 1.2 billion, consisting of $ 684.7 in cash, net of a preliminary working capital adjustment and cash transaction costs, and approximately 5.4 million shares of Post common stock, valued at $ 491.6 at the close of the transaction. Upon close of the transaction, we recognized a pre-tax loss of $ 1.0 billion. The net proceeds and pre-tax loss will be finalized during the first quarter of 2024, upon finalization of the working capital adjustment and cash transaction costs. The following table summarizes the net assets and liabilities included in the disposal group associated with the divestiture of certain pet food brands.  April 30, 2023 Assets disposed: Inventories $ 210.2  Other current assets 0.5  Property, plant, and equipment – net 179.4  Goodwill 790.3  Other intangible assets – net 1,014.4  Other noncurrent assets 1.7  Total assets disposed $ 2,196.5  Liabilities disposed: Other current liabilities $ 0.3  Other noncurrent liabilities 2.0  Total liabilities disposed 2.3  Net assets disposed $ 2,194.2   On January 31, 2022, we sold the natural beverage and grains businesses to Nexus. The transaction included products sold under the R.W. Knudsen and TruRoots brands, inclusive of certain trademarks, a licensing agreement for Santa Cruz Organic beverages, dedicated manufacturing and distribution facilities in Chico, California and Havre de Grace, Maryland, and approximately 150 employees who supported the natural beverage and grains businesses. The transaction did not include Santa Cruz Organic nut butters, fruit spreads, syrups, or applesauce. Under our ownership, the businesses generated net sales of $ 106.7 and $ 143.4 , in 2022 and 2021, respectively, primarily included in the U.S. Retail Consumer Foods segment. Final net proceeds from the divestiture were $ 98.7 , net of a working capital adjustment and cash transaction costs. We recognized a pre-tax gain of $ 28.3 related to the natural beverage and grains businesses, of which $ 26.7 was recognized during 2022, and the remaining $ 1.6 was recognized upon finalization of the working capital adjustment in 2023. On December 1, 2021, we sold the private label dry pet food business to Diamond Pet Foods. The transaction included dry pet food products sold under private label brands, a dedicated manufacturing facility located in Frontenac, Kansas, and approximately 220 employees who supported the private label dry pet food business. The transaction did not include any branded products or our private label wet pet food business. Under our ownership, the business generated net sales of $ 62.3 and $ 94.0 in 2022 and 2021, respectively, included in the U.S. Retail Pet Foods segment. Final net proceeds from the divestiture were $ 32.9 , net of cash transaction costs. Upon completion of this transaction during 2022, we recognized a pre-tax loss of $ 17.1 . On January 29, 2021, we sold the Natural Balance premium pet food business to Nexus. The transaction included pet food products sold under the Natural Balance brand, certain trademarks and licensing agreements, and select employees who supported the Natural Balance business. Under our ownership, the business generated net sales of $ 156.7 in 2021, included in the U.S. Retail Pet Foods segment. Final net proceeds from the divestiture were $ 33.8 , net of a working capital adjustment and cash transaction costs. Upon completion of this transaction, we recognized a pre-tax loss of $ 89.5 . On December 1, 2020, we sold the Crisco oils and shortening business to B&G Foods. The transaction included oils and shortening products sold under the Crisco brand, primarily in the U.S. and Canada, certain trademarks and licensing agreements, dedicated manufacturing and warehouse facilities located in Cincinnati, Ohio, and approximately 160 employees who supported the Crisco business. Under our ownership, the business generated net sales of $ 198.9 in 2021, primarily included in the U.S. Retail Consumer Foods segment. Final net proceeds from the divestiture were $ 530.2 , net of a working capital adjustment and cash transaction costs. Upon completion of this transaction, we recognized a pre-tax gain of $ 114.8 . Note 4: Reportable Segments We operate in one industry: the manufacturing and marketing of food and beverage products. We have three reportable segments: U.S. Retail Pet Foods, U.S. Retail Coffee, and U.S. Retail Consumer Foods. The presentation of International and Away From Home represents a combination of all other operating segments that are not individually reportable. The U.S. Retail Pet Foods segment primarily includes the domestic sales of Meow Mix , Milk-Bone , Pup-Peroni, and Canine Carry Outs branded products; the U.S. Retail Coffee segment primarily includes the domestic sales of Folgers , Dunkin’ , and Café Bustelo branded coffee; and the U.S. Retail Consumer Foods segment primarily includes the domestic sales of Smucker’s and Jif branded products. International and Away From Home includes the sale of products distributed domestically and in foreign countries through retail channels and foodservice distributors and operators (e.g., health care operators, restaurants, lodging, hospitality, offices, K-12, colleges and universities, and convenience stores). Under our ownership, the divested Rachael Ray Nutrish, 9Lives, Kibbles ’n Bits, Nature’s Recipe , and Gravy Train brands generated net sales of $ 1.5 billion in 2023, and $ 1.4 billion in both 2022 and 2021, primarily included in the U.S. Retail Pet Foods segment. Segment profit represents net sales, less direct and allocable operating expenses, and is consistent with the way in which we manage our segments. However, we do not represent that the segments, if operated independently, would report operating profit equal to the segment profit set forth below, as segment profit excludes certain expenses such as amortization expense and impairment charges related to intangible assets, gains and losses on divestitures, change in net cumulative unallocated derivative gains and losses, special project costs, as well as corporate administrative expenses. Commodity and foreign currency exchange derivative gains and losses are reported in unallocated derivative gains and losses outside of segment operating results until the related inventory is sold. At that time, we reclassify the hedge gains and losses from unallocated derivative gains and losses to segment profit, allowing our segments to realize the economic effect of the hedge without experiencing any mark-to-market volatility. We would expect that any gain or loss in the estimated fair value of the derivatives would generally be offset by a change in the estimated fair value of the underlying exposures. The following table reconciles segment profit to income before income taxes and presents total assets; total depreciation, amortization, and impairment charges; and total additions to property, plant, and equipment by segment.

Trade receivables – net at April 30, 2023 and 2022, included amounts due from Walmart Inc. and subsidiaries of $ 211.5 and $ 179.9 , respectively. Note 5: Earnings Per Share The following table sets forth the computation of basic earnings per share and diluted earnings per share under the two-class method.   Year Ended April 30,  2023 2022 2021 Net income (loss) $ ( 91.3 ) $ 631.7  $ 876.3  Less: Net income (loss) allocated to participating securities ( 0.1 ) 1.8  3.7  Net income (loss) allocated to common stockholders $ ( 91.2 ) $ 629.9  $ 872.6  Weighted-average common shares outstanding 106.2  107.9  112.0  Add: Dilutive effect of stock options —  —  —  Weighted-average common shares outstanding – assuming dilution 106.2  107.9  112.0  Net income (loss) per common share $ ( 0.86 ) $ 5.84  $ 7.79  Net income (loss) per common share – assuming dilution $ ( 0.86 ) $ 5.84  $ 7.79   The following table sets forth the computation of diluted earnings per share under the treasury stock method.  Year Ended April 30, 2023 2022 2021 Net income (loss) $ ( 91.3 ) $ 631.7  $ 876.3  Weighted-average common shares outstanding – assuming dilution: Weighted-average common shares outstanding 106.2  107.9  112.0  Add: Dilutive effect of stock options —  —  —  Add: Dilutive effect of restricted shares, restricted stock units, and performance units —  0.5  0.4  Weighted-average common shares outstanding – assuming dilution 106.2  108.4  112.4  Net income (loss) per common share – assuming dilution $ ( 0.86 ) $ 5.83  $ 7.80 We computed basic earnings per share under the two-class method for 2023, 2022, and 2021, due to certain unvested common shares that contained non-forfeitable rights to dividends (i.e., participating securities) during these periods. Further, we computed diluted earnings per share under the two-class method and treasury stock method to determine the method that was most dilutive, in accordance with FASB ASC 260, Earnings Per Share . In 2023, we recognized a net loss, and as a result, excluded the anti-dilutive effect of stock-based awards from the computation of net income (loss) per common share – assuming dilution. Therefore, in 2023, diluted earnings per share was computed under the two-class method. In 2022, the computation of diluted earnings per share was more dilutive under the treasury stock method, while in 2021, diluted earnings per share was more dilutive under the two-class method. Note 6: Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets The following table summarizes the changes in our goodwill.  U.S. Retail Pet Foods U.S. Retail Coffee U.S. Retail Consumer Foods International and Away From Home Total Balance at May 1, 2021 $ 2,368.2  $ 2,090.9  $ 1,147.5  $ 417.0  $ 6,023.6  Other (A) —  —  —  ( 7.8 ) ( 7.8 ) Balance at April 30, 2022 $ 2,368.2  $ 2,090.9  $ 1,147.5  $ 409.2  $ 6,015.8  Divestiture ( 788.0 ) —  —  ( 2.3 ) ( 790.3 ) Other (A) —  —  —  ( 8.6 ) ( 8.6 ) Balance at April 30, 2023 (B) $ 1,580.2  $ 2,090.9  $ 1,147.5  $ 398.3  $ 5,216.9  (A) The amounts classified as other represent foreign currency translation adjustments. (B) Included in goodwill as of April 30, 2023, are accumulated goodwill impairment charges of $ 242.9 . The following table summarizes our other intangible assets and related accumulated amortization and impairment charges, including foreign currency translation adjustments.   April 30, 2023 April 30, 2022  Acquisition Cost Accumulated Amortization/ Impairment Charges/ Foreign Currency Translation Net Acquisition Cost Accumulated Amortization/ Impairment Charges/ Foreign Currency Translation Net Finite-lived intangible assets subject to amortization: Customer and contractual relationships $ 3,499.0  $ 1,719.8  $ 1,779.2  $ 4,450.0  $ 1,724.8  $ 2,725.2  Patents and technology 167.6  161.6  6.0  167.6  155.0  12.6  Trademarks 151.4  111.6  39.8  661.7  354.1  307.6  Total intangible assets subject to amortization $ 3,818.0  $ 1,993.0  $ 1,825.0  $ 5,279.3  $ 2,233.9  $ 3,045.4  Indefinite-lived intangible assets not subject to amortization: Trademarks $ 2,830.7  $ 226.4  $ 2,604.3  $ 2,833.1  $ 226.3  $ 2,606.8  Total other intangible assets $ 6,648.7  $ 2,219.4  $ 4,429.3  $ 8,112.4  $ 2,460.2  $ 5,652.2   The decrease in finite-lived intangible assets from April 30, 2022, includes the disposal of the Rachael Ray Nutrish, 9Lives, Kibbles 'n Bits, Nature's Recipe, and Gravy Train trademarks, as well as select customer and contractual relationships and licensing agreements during the fourth quarter of 2023. For additional information, see Note 3: Divestitures. Amortization expense for finite-lived intangible assets was $ 205.9 , $ 222.5 , and $ 232.0 in 2023, 2022, and 2021, respectively. The weighted-average useful lives of the customer and contractual relationships, patents and technology, and trademarks are 24 years, 17 years, and 14 years, respectively. The weighted-average useful life of total finite-lived intangible assets is 24 years. Based on the carrying value of intangible assets subject to amortization at April 30, 2023, the estimated amortization expense is $ 156.2 for 2024, $ 153.2 for 2025, $ 151.5 for 2026, $ 150.9 for 2027, and $ 150.9 for 2028. We review goodwill and other indefinite-lived intangible assets for impairment at least annually on February 1 and more often if indicators of impairment exist. As of February 1, 2023, we completed the annual impairment review, in which goodwill impairment was tested at the reporting unit level for all of our reporting units with goodwill. As part of our annual evaluation, we did not recognize any impairment charges related to each of our reporting units and indefinite-lived intangible assets. The estimated fair value exceeded the carrying value by greater than 10 percent for all our reporting units and indefinite-lived intangible assets, with the exception of the Pet Foods reporting unit, for which its fair value exceeded its carrying value by approximately 7 percent. Subsequent to the annual impairment review, on April 28, 2023, we divested certain pet food brands, and as a result, we disposed $ 790.3 of goodwill, primarily within the Pet Foods reporting unit. The amount of goodwill allocated to the disposal group was determined based on a relative fair value analysis. In addition, the impacted reporting units were re-assessed for impairment as of April 30, 2023, and we concluded there were no indicators of impairment, as the estimated fair values were in excess of the carrying values for all reporting units. Further, the estimated fair value exceeded the carrying value of the Pet Foods reporting unit by greater than 10 percent as of April 30, 2023. However, any significant adverse change in our near or long-term projections or macroeconomic conditions could result in future impairment charges. For additional information, see Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets in Note 1: Accounting Policies and Note 3: Divestitures. In 2022, we recognized an impairment charge of $ 150.4 related to the divested Rachael Ray Nutrish brand within the U.S. Retail Pet Foods segment, primarily driven by the re-positioning of this brand within the Pet Foods brand portfolio, which led to a decline in the current and long-term net sales expectations and the royalty rate used in the valuation analysis. During 2021, we recognized an impairment charge of $ 3.8 related to an immaterial trademark within the U.S. Retail Consumer Foods segment. These charges were included as noncash charges in our Statements of Consolidated Income. Note 7: Debt and Financing Arrangements The following table summarizes the components of our long-term debt.   April 30, 2023 April 30, 2022  Principal Outstanding Carrying Amount (A) Principal Outstanding Carrying Amount (A) 3.50 % Senior Notes due March 15, 2025 $ 1,000.0  $ 998.4  $ 1,000.0  $ 997.6  3.38 % Senior Notes due December 15, 2027 500.0  498.0  500.0  497.6  2.38 % Senior Notes due March 15, 2030 500.0  496.7  500.0  496.2  2.13 % Senior Notes due March 15, 2032 500.0  494.4  500.0  493.8  4.25 % Senior Notes due March 15, 2035 650.0  645.1  650.0  644.7  2.75 % Senior Notes due September 15, 2041 300.0  297.3  300.0  297.1  4.38 % Senior Notes due March 15, 2045 600.0  588.2  600.0  587.6  3.55 % Senior Notes due March 15, 2050 300.0  296.1  300.0  296.0  Total long-term debt $ 4,350.0  $ 4,314.2  $ 4,350.0  $ 4,310.6  (A) Represents the carrying amount included in the Consolidated Balance Sheets, which includes the impact of capitalized debt issuance costs, offering discounts, and terminated interest rate contracts. In 2022, we completed an offering of $ 800.0 in Senior Notes due March 15, 2032, and September 15, 2041. The net proceeds from the offering were primarily used to repay $ 750.0 in principal of the Senior Notes due October 15, 2021. Furthermore, during 2022, we prepaid $ 400.0 in principal of the Senior Notes due March 15, 2022, and as a result, we recognized a net loss on extinguishment of $ 6.9 , which primarily consisted of a make-whole payment and was included in other income (expense) – net in the Statement of Consolidated Income. In 2022, we entered into an unsecured revolving credit facility with a group of 11 banks, which provides for a revolving credit line of $ 2.0 billion and matures in August 2026, and terminated the previous $ 1.8 billion revolving credit facility. The 2022 revolving credit facility included $ 4.3 of capitalized debt issuance costs, and is amortized to interest expense over the time for which the revolving credit facility is effective. Borrowings under the revolving credit facility bear interest on the prevailing U.S. Prime Rate, SOFR, Euro Interbank Offered Rate, or Canadian Dealer Offered Rate, based on our election. Interest is payable either on a quarterly basis or at the end of the borrowing term. We did not have a balance outstanding under the revolving credit facility at April 30, 2023, or 2022. We participate in a commercial paper program under which we can issue short-term, unsecured commercial paper not to exceed $ 2.0 billion at any time. The commercial paper program is backed by our revolving credit facility and reduces what we can borrow under the revolving credit facility by the amount of commercial paper outstanding. Commercial paper is used as a continuing source of short-term financing for general corporate purposes. As of April 30, 2022, we had $ 180.0 of short-term borrowings outstanding, which were issued under our commercial paper program at a weighted-average interest rate of 0.65 percent. As of April 30, 2023, we did not have a balance outstanding under the commercial paper program. In 2020, we completed an offering of $ 800.0 in Senior Notes due March 15, 2030, and March 15, 2050. Concurrent with the pricing of these Senior Notes, we terminated interest rate contracts that were designated as cash flow hedges and were used to manage our exposure to interest rate volatility associated with the anticipated debt financing. The termination resulted in a pre-tax loss of $ 239.8 , which was deferred and included as a component of accumulated other comprehensive income (loss) and is amortized as interest expense over the life of the debt. For additional information, see Note 9: Derivative Financial Instruments. All of our Senior Notes outstanding at April 30, 2023, are unsecured, and interest is paid semiannually, with no required scheduled principal payments until maturity. We may prepay all or part of the Senior Notes at 100 percent of the principal amount thereof, together with the accrued and unpaid interest, and any applicable make-whole amount. Interest paid totaled $ 153.1 , $ 155.2 , and $ 169.9 in 2023, 2022, and 2021, respectively. This differs from interest expense due to capitalized interest, the effect of interest rate contracts, amortization of debt issuance costs and discounts, and payment of other debt fees. Our debt instruments contain certain covenant restrictions, including an interest coverage ratio. Our financial covenant restrictions were amended to remove the leverage ratio in 2022, in conjunction with entering into the $2.0 billion unsecured revolving credit facility. We are in compliance with all covenants. Note 8: Pensions and Other Postretirement Benefits We have defined benefit pension plans covering certain U.S. and Canadian employees. Pension benefits are based on the employee’s years of service and compensation levels. Our plans are funded in conformity with the funding requirements of applicable government regulations. In addition to providing pension benefits, we sponsor several unfunded postretirement plans that provide health care and life insurance benefits to certain retired U.S. and Canadian employees. These plans are contributory, with retiree contributions adjusted periodically, and contain other cost-sharing features, such as deductibles and coinsurance. Covered employees generally are eligible for these benefits when they reach age 55 and have attained 10 years of credited service . The following table summarizes the components of net periodic benefit cost and the change in accumulated other comprehensive income (loss) related to the defined benefit pension and other postretirement plans.  Defined Benefit Pension Plans Other Postretirement Benefits  Year Ended April 30, Year Ended April 30, 2023 2022 2021 2023 2022 2021 Service cost $ 1.2  $ 1.7  $ 1.8  $ 1.0  $ 1.2  $ 1.8  Interest cost 17.8  12.4  14.4  2.3  1.3  1.8  Expected return on plan assets ( 15.4 ) ( 15.9 ) ( 19.3 ) —  —  —  Amortization of prior service cost (credit) 0.7  0.9  0.9  ( 0.6 ) ( 0.6 ) ( 1.0 ) Amortization of net actuarial loss (gain) 4.0  6.9  10.9  ( 1.2 ) ( 0.4 ) —  Settlement loss (gain) 7.4  10.8  35.5  —  —  —  Net periodic benefit cost $ 15.7  $ 16.8  $ 44.2  $ 1.5  $ 1.5  $ 2.6   Other changes in plan assets and benefit liabilities recognized in accumulated other comprehensive income (loss) before income taxes: Prior service credit (cost) arising during the year $ —  $ ( 0.4 ) $ —  $ —  $ —  $ —  Net actuarial gain (loss) arising during the year ( 11.5 ) 30.4  14.3  3.8  8.2  5.9  Amortization of prior service cost (credit) 0.7  0.9  0.9  ( 0.6 ) ( 0.6 ) ( 1.0 ) Amortization of net actuarial loss (gain) 4.0  6.9  10.9  ( 1.2 ) ( 0.4 ) —  Settlement loss (gain) 7.4  10.8  35.5  —  —  —  Foreign currency translation —  —  ( 1.5 ) ( 0.2 ) ( 0.1 ) 0.2  Net change for year $ 0.6  $ 48.6  $ 60.1  $ 1.8  $ 7.1  $ 5.1    Weighted-average assumptions used in determining net periodic benefit costs: U.S. plans: Discount rate used to determine benefit obligation 4.59  % 3.13  % 3.05  % 4.52  % 2.97  % 2.98  % Discount rate used to determine service cost 4.77  3.53  3.34  4.64  3.20  3.18  Discount rate used to determine interest cost 4.26  2.40  2.54  4.11  2.07  2.42  Expected return on plan assets 4.51  4.59  4.96  —  —  —  Rate of compensation increase 3.55  3.55  3.58  —  —  —  Canadian plans: Discount rate used to determine benefit obligation 2.41  % 2.15  % 2.95  % 4.50  % 3.03  % 2.93  % Discount rate used to determine service cost —  —  3.06  4.69  3.52  3.19  Discount rate used to determine interest cost 2.33  1.95  2.47  4.18  2.32  2.46  Expected return on plan assets 1.60  1.70  3.00  —  —  —  Rate of compensation increase —  —  3.00  —  —  —   We amortize gains and losses for our postretirement plans over the average expected future period of vested service. For plans that consist of less than 5 percent of participants that are active, average life expectancy is used instead of the average expected future service period. We use a measurement date of April 30 to determine defined benefit pension and other postretirement benefit plans’ assets and benefit obligations. The following table sets forth the combined status of the plans as recognized in the Consolidated Balance Sheets.  Defined Benefit Pension Plans Other Postretirement Benefits  Year Ended April 30, Year Ended April 30, 2023 2022 2023 2022 Change in benefit obligation: Benefit obligation at beginning of year $ 429.4  $ 546.8  $ 59.7  $ 69.6  Service cost 1.2  1.7  1.0  1.2  Interest cost 17.8  12.4  2.3  1.3  Amendments —  0.4  —  —  Actuarial loss (gain) (A) ( 14.9 ) ( 62.4 ) ( 3.8 ) ( 8.2 ) Benefits paid ( 17.7 ) ( 25.4 ) ( 4.3 ) ( 4.1 ) Settlement ( 36.1 ) ( 44.1 ) —  —  Foreign currency translation adjustments —  —  ( 0.2 ) ( 0.1 ) Benefit obligation at end of year $ 379.7  $ 429.4  $ 54.7  $ 59.7  Change in plan assets: Fair value of plan assets at beginning of year $ 317.1  $ 397.8  $ —  $ —  Actual return on plan assets ( 11.1 ) ( 16.1 ) —  —  Company contributions 74.1  5.3  4.3  4.1  Benefits paid ( 17.7 ) ( 25.4 ) ( 4.3 ) ( 4.1 ) Settlement ( 36.1 ) ( 44.1 ) —  —  Foreign currency translation adjustments ( 0.4 ) ( 0.4 ) —  —  Fair value of plan assets at end of year $ 325.9  $ 317.1  $ —  $ —  Funded status of the plans $ ( 53.8 ) $ ( 112.3 ) $ ( 54.7 ) $ ( 59.7 ) Defined benefit pensions $ ( 62.1 ) $ ( 114.9 ) $ —  $ —  Other noncurrent assets 12.3  6.6  —  —  Accrued compensation ( 4.0 ) ( 4.0 ) ( 5.6 ) ( 5.5 ) Other postretirement benefits —  —  ( 49.1 ) ( 54.2 ) Net benefit liability $ ( 53.8 ) $ ( 112.3 ) $ ( 54.7 ) $ ( 59.7 )  (A) The actuarial losses and gains for our defined benefit pension plans and other postretirement benefits were primarily due to changes in the discount rates used in determining the plan obligations. The following table summarizes amounts recognized in accumulated other comprehensive income (loss) in the Consolidated Balance Sheets, before income taxes.

The rate for participants under age 65 is assumed to decrease to 5.0 percent in 2032 for the U.S. plan and remain at 4.5 percent for the Canadian plan. The health care cost trend rate assumption impacts the amount of the other postretirement benefits obligation and periodic other postretirement benefits cost reported. The following table sets forth selective information pertaining to our Canadian pension and other postretirement benefit plans, which is included in the consolidated information presented on pages 68 and 69.   Defined Benefit Pension Plans Other Postretirement Benefits Year Ended April 30, Year Ended April 30, 2023 2022 2023 2022 Benefit obligation at end of year $ 0.4  $ 2.0  $ 3.9  $ 4.9  Fair value of plan assets at end of year 6.5  8.1  —  —  Funded status of the plans $ 6.1  $ 6.1  $ ( 3.9 ) $ ( 4.9 ) Components of net periodic benefit cost: Interest cost $ 0.1  $ 0.1  $ 0.2  $ 0.1  Expected return on plan assets ( 0.1 ) 0.1  —  —  Amortization of net actuarial loss (gain) —  —  ( 0.2 ) ( 0.1 ) Settlement loss (gain) 0.7  —  —  —  Net periodic benefit cost (credit) $ 0.7  $ 0.2  $ —  $ —  Changes in plan assets: Actual return on plan assets $ 0.1  $ 0.3  $ —  $ —  Company contributions 0.1  ( 0.4 ) 0.3  0.4  Benefits paid 7.1  ( 0.3 ) ( 0.3 ) ( 0.4 ) Settlement ( 8.4 ) —  —  —  Foreign currency translation ( 0.4 ) ( 0.4 ) —  —  During 2021, we transferred $ 82.6 of our Canadian defined benefit pension plan obligations to an insurance company through the purchase of an irrevocable group annuity contract (the “Canadian buy-out contract”). The group annuity contract was purchased using assets from the pension trust. As a result of this transaction, during 2021, we recognized a noncash pre-tax settlement charge of $ 29.6 to accelerate the unrecognized losses within accumulated other comprehensive income (loss) that would have otherwise been recognized in subsequent periods. This settlement charge was included within other income (expense) – net in the Statement of Consolidated Income. We did not recognize any additional charges related to the Canadian buy-out contract during 2023 and 2022. We expect to finalize the wind-up of the Canadian pension plan impacted by the buy-out in 2024, upon Board approval for payout of the surplus. The following table sets forth additional information related to our defined benefit pension plans.   April 30,  2023 2022 Accumulated benefit obligation for all pension plans $ 374.6  $ 423.9  Plans with an accumulated benefit obligation in excess of plan assets: Accumulated benefit obligation (A) $ 194.6  $ 422.4  Fair value of plan assets 133.1  309.0  Plans with a projected benefit obligation in excess of plan assets: Projected benefit obligation (A) $ 198.9  $ 427.8  Fair value of plan assets 133.1  309.0   (A) The decrease in our defined benefit pension plan obligations for plans in excess of plan assets, as compared to 2022, is primarily driven by the fact that we made contributions during 2023, which significantly improved the funded status of the majority of our defined benefit pension plans. We employ a total return on investment approach for the defined benefit pension plans’ assets. A mix of equity, fixed-income, and alternative investments is used to maximize the long-term rate of return on assets for the level of risk. In determining the expected long-term rate of return on the defined benefit pension plans’ assets, we consider the historical rates of return, the nature of investments, the asset allocation, and expectations of future investment strategies. Based on our improved funded status, our current investment policy includes a mix of investments that consist of approximately 80 percent fixed-income securities and 20 percent equity securities. The following tables summarize the major asset classes for the U.S. and Canadian defined benefit pension plans and the levels within the fair value hierarchy for those assets measured at fair value.  Quoted Prices in Active Markets for Identical Assets (Level 1) Significant Observable Inputs (Level 2) Significant Unobservable Inputs (Level 3) Plan Assets at April 30, 2023 Cash and cash equivalents (A) $ 30.1  $ —  $ —  $ 30.1  Equity securities: U.S. (B) 2.6  —  —  2.6  International (C) 6.7  —  —  6.7  Fixed-income securities: Bonds (D) 259.6  —  —  259.6  Other types of investments (F) —  26.9  —  26.9  Total financial assets measured at fair value $ 299.0  $ 26.9  $ —  $ 325.9  Total financial assets measured at net asset value (G) —  Total plan assets $ 325.9   Quoted Prices in Active Markets for Identical Assets (Level 1) Significant Observable Inputs (Level 2) Significant Unobservable Inputs (Level 3) Plan Assets at April 30, 2022 Cash and cash equivalents (A) $ 8.1  $ —  $ —  $ 8.1  Equity securities: U.S. (B) 29.8  —  —  29.8  International (C) 33.3  —  —  33.3  Fixed-income securities: Bonds (D) 187.3  —  —  187.3  Fixed income (E) 6.6  —  —  6.6  Other types of investments (F) —  50.9  —  50.9  Total financial assets measured at fair value $ 265.1  $ 50.9  $ —  $ 316.0  Total financial assets measured at net asset value (G) 1.1  Total plan assets $ 317.1   (A) This category includes money market holdings with maturities of three months or less and are classified as Level 1 assets. Based on the short-term nature of these assets, carrying value approximates fair value. (B) This category is invested in a diversified portfolio of common stocks and index funds that primarily invest in U.S. stocks with broad market capitalization ranges similar to those found in the S&P 500 Index and/or the various Russell Indices, and are traded on active exchanges. The Level 1 assets are valued using quoted market prices for identical securities in active markets. (C) This category is invested primarily in common stocks and other equity securities traded on active exchanges of foreign issuers located outside the U.S. The fund invests primarily in developed countries, but may also invest in emerging markets. The Level 1 assets are valued using quoted market prices for identical securities in active markets. (D) This category is primarily composed of bond funds, which seek to duplicate the return characteristics of high-quality U.S. and foreign corporate bonds with a duration range of 10 to 13 years, as well as various U.S. Treasury Separate Trading of Registered Interest and Principal holdings, with wide-ranging maturity dates. These assets are valued using quoted market prices for identical securities in active markets and are classified as Level 1 assets. (E) This category was composed of fixed-income funds that were invested primarily in government-related bonds of non-U.S. issuers and included investments in the Canadian, as well as emerging markets. These assets were valued using quoted market prices for identical securities in active markets and were classified as Level 1 assets. (F) This category is composed of a real estate fund whereby the underlying investments are contained in the Canadian market and a common collective trust fund investing in direct commercial property funds. The real estate fund and the collective trust fund investing in direct commercial property are classified as Level 2 assets, whereby the underlying securities are valued utilizing quoted market prices for identical securities in active markets and based on the quoted market prices of the underlying investments in the common collective trust, respectively. (G) This category was composed of a private equity fund that consisted primarily of limited partnership interests in corporate finance and venture capital funds, as well as a private limited investment partnership. The fair value estimates of the private equity fund and private limited investment partnership were based on the underlying funds’ net asset values. Furthermore, as a practical expedient equivalent to our defined benefit plan’s ownership interest in the partners’ capital, a proportionate share of the net assets was attributed and further corroborated by our review. The private equity fund and private limited investment partnership were non-redeemable, and the return of principal was based on the liquidation of the underlying assets. In accordance with ASU 2015-07, the private equity fund and private limited investment partnership were removed from the total financial assets measured at fair value and disclosed separately. In 2024, we do not expect to make any contributions to our U.S. qualified defined benefit pension plans; however, we do expect to make direct benefit payments of approximately $ 9.8 in 2024. Further, we expect the following payments to be made from the defined benefit pension and other postretirement benefit plans: $ 40.4 in 2024, $ 41.1 in 2025, $ 35.0 in 2026, $ 34.2 in 2027, $ 33.5 in 2028, and $ 165.5 in 2029 through 2033. Multi-Employer Pension Plan: We participate in one multi-employer pension plan, the Bakery and Confectionery Union and Industry International Pension Fund (“Bakery and Confectionery Union Fund”) (52-6118572), which provides defined benefits to certain union employees. During 2023 and 2022, a total of $ 2.0 and $ 2.6 was contributed to the plan, respectively, and we anticipate contributions of $ 2.8 in 2024. The risks of participating in multi-employer pension plans are different from the risks of participating in single-employer pension plans. For instance, the assets contributed to the multi-employer plan by one employer may be used to provide benefits to employees of other participating employers, and if a participating employer stops contributing to the plan, the unfunded obligations of the plan allocable to the withdrawing employer may be the responsibility of the remaining participating employers. Additionally, if we stop participating in the multi-employer pension plan, we may be required to pay the plan an amount based on our allocable share of the underfunded status of the plan, referred to as a withdrawal liability. The Pension Protection Act of 2006 ranks the funded status of multi-employer pension plans depending upon a plan’s current and projected funding. A plan is in the Red Zone (Critical) if it has a current funded percentage less than 65 percent. A plan is in the Yellow Zone (Endangered) if it has a current funded percentage of less than 80 percent or projects a credit balance deficit within seven years. A plan is in the Green Zone (Healthy) if it has a current funded percentage greater than 80 percent and does not have a projected credit balance deficit within seven years. The zone status is based on the plan’s year-end, not our fiscal year-end. The zone status is based on information that we received from the plan and is certified by the plan’s actuary. During calendar year 2022, the Bakery and Confectionery Union Fund was in Red Zone status, as the current funding status was 49.4 percent. A funding improvement plan, or rehabilitation plan, has been implemented. The American Rescue Plan Act (the “ARPA”), signed into law on March 11, 2021, established a special financial assistance program for financially troubled multi-employer pension plans. Under the ARPA, eligible multi-employer plans can apply to receive a cash payment in an amount projected by the Pension Benefit Guaranty Corporation to pay pension benefits through the plan year ending 2051. On March 1, 2023, the Bakery and Confectionery Union Fund applied for assistance under the ARPA program. Note 9: Derivative Financial Instruments We are exposed to market risks, such as changes in commodity prices, foreign currency exchange rates, and interest rates. To manage the volatility related to these exposures, we enter into various derivative transactions. We have policies in place that define acceptable instrument types we may enter into and establish controls to limit our market risk exposure. Commodity Derivatives: We enter into commodity derivatives to manage the price volatility and reduce the variability of future cash flows related to anticipated inventory purchases of key raw materials, notably green coffee, corn, soybean meal, edible oils, and wheat. We also enter into commodity derivatives to manage price risk for energy input costs, including diesel fuel and natural gas. Our derivative instruments generally have maturities of less than one year . We do not qualify commodity derivatives for hedge accounting treatment, and as a result, the derivative gains and losses are immediately recognized in earnings. Although we do not perform the assessments required to achieve hedge accounting for derivative positions, we believe all of our commodity derivatives are economic hedges of our risk exposure. The commodities hedged have a high inverse correlation to price changes of the derivative instrument. Thus, we would expect that over time any gain or loss in the estimated fair value of its derivatives would generally be offset by an increase or decrease in the estimated fair value of the underlying exposures. Foreign Currency Exchange Derivatives: We utilize foreign currency derivatives to manage the effect of foreign currency exchange fluctuations on future cash payments primarily related to purchases of certain raw materials and finished goods. The contracts generally have maturities of less than one year . We do not qualify instruments used to manage foreign currency exchange exposures for hedge accounting treatment. Interest Rate Derivatives: We utilize derivative instruments to manage interest rate risk associated with anticipated debt transactions, as well as to manage changes in the fair value of our long-term debt. At the inception of an interest rate contract, the instrument is evaluated and documented for qualifying hedge accounting treatment. If the contract is designated as a cash flow hedge, the mark-to-market gains or losses on the contract are deferred and included as a component of accumulated other comprehensive income (loss) and generally reclassified to interest expense in the period during which the hedged transaction affects earnings. If the contract is designated as a fair value hedge, the contract is recognized at fair value on the balance sheet, and changes in the fair value are recognized in interest expense. Generally, changes in the fair value of the contract are equal to changes in the fair value of the underlying debt and have no net impact on earnings. The following table presents the gross notional value of outstanding derivative contracts.   Year Ended April 30,  2023 2022 Commodity contracts $ 448.1  $ 2,086.2  Foreign currency exchange contracts 98.1  91.3   The following tables set forth the gross fair value amounts of derivative instruments recognized in the Consolidated Balance Sheets.

We are required to maintain cash margin accounts in connection with funding the settlement of our open positions. Our cash margin accounts represented collateral pledged of $ 17.0 and $ 54.6 at April 30, 2023 and 2022, respectively, and are included in other current assets in the Consolidated Balance Sheets. The change in the cash margin accounts is included in other – net, investing activities in the Statements of Consolidated Cash Flows. In the event of default and immediate net settlement of all of our open positions with individual counterparties, all of our derivative liabilities would be fully offset by either our derivative asset positions or margin accounts based on the net asset or liability position with our individual counterparties. Cash flows associated with the settlement of derivative instruments are classified in the same line item as the cash flows of the related hedged item, which is within operating activities in the Statements of Consolidated Cash Flows. Economic Hedges The following table presents the net gains and losses recognized in cost of products sold on derivatives not designated as hedging instruments.   Year Ended April 30,  2023 2022 2021 Derivative gains (losses) on commodity contracts $ ( 6.1 ) $ 74.1  $ 101.4  Derivative gains (losses) on foreign currency exchange contracts 4.4  4.2  ( 8.8 ) Total derivative gains (losses) recognized in cost of products sold $ ( 1.7 ) $ 78.3  $ 92.6   Commodity and foreign currency exchange derivative gains and losses are reported in unallocated derivative gains and losses outside of segment operating results until the related inventory is sold. At that time, we reclassify the hedge gains and losses from unallocated derivative gains and losses to segment profit, allowing our segments to realize the economic effect of the hedge without experiencing any mark-to-market volatility. The following table presents the net change in cumulative unallocated derivative gains and losses.   Year Ended April 30,  2023 2022 2021 Net derivative gains (losses) recognized and classified as unallocated $ ( 1.7 ) $ 78.3  $ 92.6  Less: Net derivative gains (losses) reclassified to segment operating profit 19.7  101.7  ( 1.0 ) Change in net cumulative unallocated derivative gains and losses $ ( 21.4 ) $ ( 23.4 ) $ 93.6   The net cumulative unallocated derivative gains were $ 15.9 and $ 37.3 at April 30, 2023 and 2022, respectively. Cash Flow Hedges In 2020, we terminated all outstanding interest rate contracts concurrent with the pricing of the Senior Notes due March 15, 2030, and March 15, 2050. The contracts were designated as cash flow hedges and were used to manage our exposure to interest rate volatility associated with the anticipated debt financing. The termination resulted in a pre-tax loss of $ 239.8 , which was deferred and included as a component of accumulated other comprehensive income (loss) and is being amortized as interest expense over the life of the debt. The following table presents information on the pre-tax gains and losses recognized on all contracts previously designated as cash flow hedges.  Year Ended April 30, 2023 2022 2021 Gains (losses) recognized in other comprehensive income (loss) $ —  $ —  $ —  Less: Gains (losses) reclassified from accumulated other comprehensive income (loss) to interest expense – net (A) ( 13.5 ) ( 13.7 ) ( 13.8 ) Less: Gains (losses) reclassified from accumulated other comprehensive income to other (expense) – net (B) —  0.6  —  Change in accumulated other comprehensive income (loss) $ 13.5  $ 13.1  $ 13.8  (A) Interest expense – net, as presented in the Statements of Consolidated Income, was $ 152.0 , $ 160.9 , and $ 177.1 in 2023, 2022, and 2021, respectively. The reclassification includes terminated contracts which were designated as cash flow hedges. (B) Other income (expense) – net, as presented in the Statements of Consolidated Income, was $ 14.7 , $ 19.1 , and $ 37.8 in 2023, 2022, and 2021, respectively. The reclassification is related to the debt extinguishment during 2022, as discussed in Note 7: Debt and Financing Arrangements. Included as a component of accumulated other comprehensive income (loss) at April 30, 2023 and 2022, were deferred net pre-tax losses of $ 200.7 and $ 214.2 , respectively, related to the terminated interest rate contracts. The related net tax benefit recognized in accumulated other comprehensive income (loss) was $ 47.1 and $ 50.3 at April 30, 2023 and 2022, respectively. Approximately $ 13.6 of the net pre-tax loss will be recognized over the next 12 months related to the terminated interest rate contracts. Fair Value Hedges In 2015, we terminated the interest rate swap on the Senior Notes due October 15, 2021, which was designated as a fair value hedge and used to hedge against the changes in the fair value of the debt. As a result of the early termination, we received $ 58.1 in cash, which included $ 4.6 of accrued and prepaid interest. The gain on termination was recorded as an increase in the long-term debt balance and was recognized over the life of the debt as a reduction of interest expense. As of April 30, 2022, we had fully recognized the gain of $ 53.5 , of which $ 4.0 and $ 8.4 were recognized in 2022 and 2021, respectively. Note 10: Other Financial Instruments and Fair Value Measurements Financial instruments, other than derivatives, that potentially subject us to significant concentrations of credit risk consist principally of cash investments, short-term borrowings, and trade receivables. The carrying value of these financial instruments approximates fair value. Our remaining financial instruments, with the exception of long-term debt, are recognized at estimated fair value in the Consolidated Balance Sheets. The following table provides information on the carrying amounts and fair values of our financial instruments.   April 30, 2023 April 30, 2022  Carrying Amount Fair Value Carrying Amount Fair Value Marketable securities and other investments $ 24.0  $ 24.0  $ 26.6  $ 26.6  Derivative financial instruments – net 4.7  4.7  24.8  24.8  Investment in equity securities 487.8  487.8  —  —  Total long-term debt ( 4,314.2 ) ( 3,879.1 ) ( 4,310.6 ) ( 3,977.7 ) Fair value is defined as the price that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between market participants at the measurement date. Valuation techniques are based on observable and unobservable inputs. Observable inputs reflect readily obtainable data from independent sources, while unobservable inputs reflect our market assumptions. The following tables summarize the fair values and the levels within the fair value hierarchy in which the fair value measurements fall for our financial instruments.  Quoted Prices in Active Markets for Identical Assets (Level 1) Significant Observable Inputs (Level 2) Significant Unobservable Inputs (Level 3) Fair Value at April 30, 2023 Marketable securities and other investments: (A) Equity mutual funds $ 5.0  $ —  $ —  $ 5.0  Municipal obligations —  18.6  —  18.6  Money market funds 0.4  —  —  0.4  Derivative financial instruments: (B) Commodity contracts – net 2.7  0.7  —  3.4  Foreign currency exchange contracts – net 0.2  1.1  —  1.3  Investment in equity securities (C) 487.8  —  —  487.8  Total long-term debt (D) ( 3,879.1 ) —  —  ( 3,879.1 ) Total financial instruments measured at fair value $ ( 3,383.0 ) $ 20.4  $ —  $ ( 3,362.6 )  Quoted Prices in Active Markets for Identical Assets (Level 1) Significant Observable Inputs (Level 2) Significant Unobservable Inputs (Level 3) Fair Value at April 30, 2022 Marketable securities and other investments: (A) Equity mutual funds $ 5.7  $ —  $ —  $ 5.7  Municipal obligations —  19.9  —  19.9  Money market funds 1.0  —  —  1.0  Derivative financial instruments: (B) Commodity contracts – net 23.4  ( 0.3 ) —  23.1  Foreign currency exchange contracts – net 0.2  1.5  —  1.7  Total long-term debt (D) ( 3,977.7 ) —  —  ( 3,977.7 ) Total financial instruments measured at fair value $ ( 3,947.4 ) $ 21.1  $ —  $ ( 3,926.3 ) (A) Marketable securities and other investments consist of funds maintained for the payment of benefits associated with nonqualified retirement plans. The funds include equity securities listed in active markets, municipal obligations valued by a third-party using valuation techniques that utilize inputs that are derived principally from or corroborated by observable market data, and money market funds with maturities of three months or less. Based on the short-term nature of these money market funds, carrying value approximates fair value. As of April 30, 2023, our municipal obligations are scheduled to mature as follows: $ 1.6 in 2024, $ 1.3 in 2025, $ 0.8 in 2026, $ 4.9 in 2027, $ 0.4 in 2028, and the remaining $ 9.6 in 2029 and beyond. For additional information, see Marketable Securities and Other Investments in Note 1: Accounting Policies. (B) Level 1 commodity and foreign currency exchange derivatives are valued using quoted market prices for identical instruments in active markets. Level 2 commodity and foreign currency exchange derivatives are valued using quoted prices for similar assets or liabilities in active markets. For additional information, see Note 9: Derivative Financial Instruments. (C) The market approach is utilized to measure the fair value of equity securities. The investment in equity securities represents our equity interest in Post of approximately 8 percent as of April 30, 2023, which is valued using the trading value of Post common stock. In 2023, we recognized an unrealized pre-tax loss of $ 3.8 on the investment, which was included in other income (expense) – net in the Statement of Consolidated Income. For additional information, see Investment in Equity Securities in Note 1: Accounting Policies and Note 3: Divestitures. (D) Long-term debt is composed of public Senior Notes, which are traded in an active secondary market and valued using quoted prices. For additional information, see Note 7: Debt and Financing Arrangements. During 2023, we recognized a loss on divestiture in our Statement of Consolidated Income related to the divestiture of certain pet food brands. The loss on divestiture included the impact of an allocation of $ 790.3 of goodwill, primarily in the U.S. Retail Pet Foods segment, which was determined based on a relative fair value analysis. The impact of the goodwill disposed was included in the noncash pre-tax loss on the divestiture in our Statement of Consolidated Income. We recognized an impairment charge of $ 150.4 during 2022 related to the divested Rachael Ray Nutrish brand within the U.S. Retail Pet Foods segment. During 2021, we recognized an impairment charge of $ 3.8 related to an immaterial trademark within the U.S. Retail Consumer Foods segment. These charges were included as noncash charges in our Statements of Consolidated Income. We utilized Level 3 inputs based on management’s best estimates and assumptions to estimate the fair value of the indefinite-lived trademarks. For additional information, see Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets in Note 1: Accounting Policies and Note 6: Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets. Note 11: Leases We lease certain warehouses, manufacturing facilities, office space, equipment, and vehicles, primarily through operating lease agreements. We have elected to not recognize leases with a term of 12 months or less in the Consolidated Balance Sheets. Instead, we recognize the related lease expense on a straight-line basis over the lease term. Although the majority of our right-of-use asset and lease liability balances consist of leases with renewal options, these optional periods do not typically impact the lease term as we are not reasonably certain to exercise them. Certain leases also include termination provisions or options to purchase the leased property. Since we are not reasonably certain to exercise these types of options, minimum lease payments do not include any amounts related to these termination or purchase options. Our lease agreements generally do not contain residual value guarantees or restrictive covenants that are material. We determine if an agreement is or contains a lease at inception by evaluating whether an identified asset exists that we control over the term of the arrangement. A lease commences when the lessor makes the identified asset available for our use. We generally account for lease and non-lease components as a single lease component. Minimum lease payments do not include variable lease payments other than those that depend on an index or rate. Because the interest rate implicit in the lease cannot be readily determined for the majority of our leases, we utilize our incremental borrowing rate to present value lease payments using information available at the lease commencement date. We consider our credit rating and the current economic environment in determining this collateralized rate. As of April 30, 2023, we have entered into a lease commitment related to a distribution center for which the lease has not yet commenced as of that date. The lease will begin during the first quarter of 2024, and upon commencement, we expect to recognize a right-of-use asset and lease liability of approximately $ 75.8 in the Condensed Consolidated Balance Sheet. The following table sets forth the right-of-use assets and lease liabilities recognized in the Consolidated Balance Sheets.  Year Ended April 30, 2023 2022 Operating lease right-of-use assets $ 103.0  $ 106.5  Operating lease liabilities: Current operating lease liabilities $ 33.2  $ 40.1  Noncurrent operating lease liabilities 77.2  76.2  Total operating lease liabilities $ 110.4  $ 116.3  Finance lease right-of-use assets: Machinery and equipment $ 7.7  $ 8.1  Accumulated depreciation ( 4.4 ) ( 4.3 ) Total property, plant, and equipment $ 3.3  $ 3.8  Finance lease liabilities: Other current liabilities $ 1.2  $ 1.4  Other noncurrent liabilities 2.2  2.5  Total finance lease liabilities $ 3.4  $ 3.9  The following table summarizes the components of lease expense.

Currently, these incentives consist of restricted shares, restricted stock units (which may also be referred to as deferred stock units), performance units, and stock options. During 2023 and 2022, these awards were administered through the 2020 Equity and Incentive Compensation Plan (the “2020 Plan”), which was approved by our shareholders in August 2020. The previous 2010 Equity and Incentive Compensation Plan (the “2010 Plan”) expired and the 2020 Plan became effective in November 2020, at which time the common shares remaining available for issuance under the 2010 Plan were transferred to the 2020 Plan. During 2021, awards were administered through the 2010 Plan and the 2020 Plan. Awards under these plans may be in the form of stock options, stock appreciation rights, restricted shares, restricted stock units, performance shares, performance units, incentive awards, and other share-based awards, and they may be granted to our non-employee directors, consultants, officers, and other employees. Deferred stock units granted to non-employee directors vest immediately and, along with dividends credited on those deferred stock units, are paid out in the form of common shares upon termination of service as a non-employee director. At April 30, 2023, there were 3,967,804 shares available for future issuance under the 2020 Plan. Under the 2020 Plan, we have the option to settle share-based awards by issuing common shares from treasury, issuing new Company common shares, or issuing a combination of common shares from treasury and new Company common shares. Stock Options: Under the 2020 Plan, we granted 113,970 and 152,971 stock options during 2023 and 2022, respectively, and under the 2010 Plan, we granted 296,619 stock options during 2021. Stock options granted in 2023, 2022, and 2021 vest ratably over a period of three years . The exercise price of all stock options granted was equal to the market value of the shares on the date of grant, and all stock options granted and outstanding have a contractual term of 10 years. The fair value of each stock option is estimated on the date of grant using a Black-Scholes option-pricing model with the following weighted-average assumptions for stock options granted:  2023 2022 2021 Expected volatility 25.0  % 24.0  % 23.0  % Dividend yield 3.1  % 2.7  % 3.2  % Risk-free interest rate 3.6  % 1.0  % 0.4  % Expected life of stock options (years) 6.0 6.0 6.0  Expected volatility was calculated in accordance with the provisions of FASB ASC 718, Compensation – Stock Compensation , based on consideration of both historical and implied volatilities. The expected life of a stock option represents the period from the grant date through the expected exercise date of the option. This was calculated using a simplified method whereby the midpoint between the vesting date and the end of the contractual term is utilized to compute the expected term. The following table is a summary of our stock option activity.  Number of Stock Options Weighted-Average Exercise Price Outstanding at May 1, 2022 727,742  $ 118.37  Granted 113,970  125.82  Exercised ( 207,576 ) 113.14  Cancelled ( 27,658 ) 123.40  Outstanding at April 30, 2023 606,478  $ 121.33  Exercisable at April 30, 2023 345,948  $ 119.12   The intrinsic value of a stock option is the amount by which the market value of the underlying stock exceeds the exercise price of the stock option. The total intrinsic value for stock options outstanding and exercisable was $ 20.1 and $ 12.2 at April 30, 2023, respectively, with an average remaining contractual term of 7.2 years and 6.5 years, respectively. The total intrinsic value of stock options exercised during 2023, 2022, and 2021 was $ 8.6 , $ 3.6 , and $ 0.6 , respectively. The closing market price of our common stock on the last trading day of 2023 was $ 154.41 per share. The stock options granted during 2023 have a weighted-average grant date fair value of $ 26.27 per option. Compensation cost related to stock options is recognized ratably over the service period from the grant date through the end of the requisite service period. During 2023, 2022 and 2021, we recognized compensation cost of $ 3.1 , $ 3.0 , and $ 2.3 , respectively. The tax benefit related to the stock option expense was $ 0.7 , $ 0.7 , and $ 0.5 for 2023, 2022, and 2021, respectively. As of April 30, 2023, we had unrecognized compensation cost of $ 3.1 related to the stock options that were granted in 2023, 2022, and 2021. Cash received from stock option exercises was $ 21.6 , $ 16.3 , and $ 4.5 for the years ended April 30, 2023, 2022, and 2021, respectively. Other Equity Awards: The following table is a summary of our restricted shares, deferred stock units, and performance units.  Restricted Shares and Deferred Stock Units Weighted- Average Grant Date Fair Value Per Share Performance Units Weighted- Average Grant Date Fair Value Per Share Outstanding at May 1, 2022 431,055  $ 117.24  462,477  $ 124.22  Granted 146,290  131.96  130,939  133.01  Vested ( 185,183 ) 109.72  ( 75,218 ) 123.68  Forfeited ( 37,438 ) 124.65  ( 104,308 ) 125.47  Outstanding at April 30, 2023 354,724  $ 126.45  413,890  $ 126.78   The weighted-average grant date fair value of equity awards other than stock options that vested in 2023, 2022, and 2021 was $ 30.6 , $ 21.7 , and $ 23.1 , respectively. The weighted-average grant date fair value of restricted shares, deferred stock units, and performance units is the average of the high and the low share price on the date of grant. The vesting date fair value of equity awards other than stock options that vested in 2023, 2022, and 2021 was $ 36.2 , $ 24.0 , and $ 19.7 , respectively. The following table summarizes the weighted-average fair values of the equity awards granted.  Year Ended April 30, Restricted Shares and Deferred Stock Units Weighted- Average Grant Date Fair Value Per Share Performance Units Weighted- Average Grant Date Fair Value Per Share 2023 146,290  $ 131.96  130,939  $ 133.01  2022 66,514  135.10  171,907  135.53  2021 83,188  110.66  194,786  113.70   The restricted shares and deferred stock units granted in 2023, 2022, and 2021 under our new long-term incentive compensation program vest ratably over three years from the date of grant. The remaining restricted shares and deferred stock units generally vest over four years from the date of grant or upon the attainment of a defined age and years of service, subject to certain retention requirements. The performance units granted in 2023, 2022, and 2021 vest three years from the date of grant and are converted to common shares upon vesting based on the performance achieved during the service period. The performance goal for the performance units is based on adjusted earnings per share and return on invested capital targets. Dividend equivalents are accumulated on the performance units from the date of grant, but participants only receive payment if the awards vest. Note 13: Income Taxes The following table sets forth our income (loss) before income taxes.  Year Ended April 30,  2023 2022 2021 Domestic $ ( 23.6 ) $ 806.0  $ 1,176.6  Foreign 14.4  37.8  ( 4.7 ) Income (loss) before income taxes $ ( 9.2 ) $ 843.8  $ 1,171.9   The following table summarizes the components of the provision for income taxes.

The income tax expense of $ 212.1 for 2022 includes an unfavorable deferred tax impact, primarily related to an internal legal entity simplification to support multiple work locations for office-based employees and our continued strategic activities. The income tax expense of $ 295.6 for 2021 includes the permanent tax impacts associated with the sales of the Crisco and Natural Balance businesses. We are a voluntary participant in the Compliance Assurance Process (“CAP”) program offered by the IRS and are currently under a CAP examination for the tax years ended April 30, 2023 and April 30, 2024. For the 2019 through 2022 tax years, the CAP examination is substantially complete and awaiting final closing documentation. The tax years prior to 2020 are no longer subject to U.S. federal tax examination under the statute of limitations. With limited exceptions, we are no longer subject to examination for state, local, and foreign jurisdictions for the tax years prior to 2019. Deferred income taxes reflect the tax effects of temporary differences between the carrying amounts of assets and liabilities for financial reporting purposes and the amounts used for income tax reporting. The following table summarizes significant components of our deferred tax assets and liabilities.   April 30,  2023 2022 Deferred tax liabilities: Intangible assets $ 1,119.9  $ 1,303.5  Property, plant, and equipment 192.0  174.7  Leases 15.6  21.8  Other 8.2  19.2  Total deferred tax liabilities $ 1,335.7  $ 1,519.2  Deferred tax assets: Post-employment and other employee benefits $ 75.1  $ 66.2  Tax credit and loss carryforwards 26.1  27.8  Intangible assets 19.0  15.9  Hedging transactions 46.9  47.6  Leases 17.5  23.5  Other 38.2  42.3  Total deferred tax assets $ 222.8  $ 223.3  Valuation allowance ( 26.0 ) ( 29.9 ) Total deferred tax assets, less allowance $ 196.8  $ 193.4  Net deferred tax liability $ 1,138.9  $ 1,325.8   We evaluate the realizability of deferred tax assets for each of the jurisdictions in which we operate. The total valuation allowance decreased by an immaterial amount during the year. We did not repatriate foreign cash to the U.S. during both 2023 and 2022. We returned $ 100.0 of foreign cash to the U.S. from Canada during 2021, net of $ 5.0 of foreign withholding taxes and insignificant U.S. federal and state income taxes. Consistent with the prior year, as of April 30, 2023, we have determined that a portion of our undistributed earnings, in Canada, is not permanently reinvested, resulting in the recognition of an immaterial deferred tax liability. Deferred income taxes have not been provided on approximately $ 30.0 of the remaining temporary differences of our foreign subsidiaries, primarily Canada, that are determined to be permanently reinvested, the tax effects of which are immaterial. Our unrecognized tax benefits were $ 5.3 , $ 6.5 , and $ 10.2 , of which $ 4.2 , $ 5.1 , and $ 8.1 would affect the effective income tax rate, if recognized, as of April 30, 2023, 2022, and 2021, respectively. Within the next 12 months, it is reasonably possible that we could decrease our unrecognized tax benefits by an estimated $ 1.8 , primarily as a result of the expiration of statute of limitation periods. The following table sets forth a reconciliation of our unrecognized tax benefits.  2023 2022 2021 Balance at May 1, $ 6.5  $ 10.2  $ 13.1  Increases: Current year tax positions —  0.1  0.7  Prior year tax positions —  0.2  —  Decreases: Expiration of statute of limitations periods 1.2  4.0  2.6  Prior year tax positions —  —  1.0  Balance at April 30, $ 5.3  $ 6.5  $ 10.2   Note 14: Accumulated Other Comprehensive Income (Loss) The components of accumulated other comprehensive income (loss), including the reclassification adjustments for items that are reclassified from accumulated other comprehensive income (loss) to net income (loss), are shown below.

For additional information, see Note 9: Derivative Financial Instruments. (B) The reclassification from accumulated other comprehensive income (loss) to other income (expense) – net is composed of settlement charges and amortization of net losses and prior service costs. The reclassification in 2021 primarily includes the impact of the nonrecurring settlement charges related to the Canadian buy-out contract. For additional information, see Note 8: Pensions and Other Postretirement Benefits . Note 15: Contingencies \", 'We, like other food manufacturers, are from time to time subject to various administrative, regulatory, and other legal proceedings arising in the ordinary course of business. We are currently a defendant in a variety of such legal proceedings, including certain lawsuits related to the alleged price-fixing of shelf stable tuna products prior to 2011 by a business previously owned by, but divested prior to our acquisition of, Big Heart, the significant majority of which were settled and paid during 2019 and 2020. While we cannot predict with certainty the ultimate results of these proceedings or potential settlements associated with these or other matters, we have accrued losses for certain contingent liabilities that we have determined are probable and reasonably estimable at April 30, 2023. Based on the information known to date, with the exception of the matters discussed below, we do not believe the final outcome of these proceedings would have a material adverse effect on our financial position, results of operations, or cash flows. ', 'In addition to the legal proceedings discussed above, we are defendants in a series of putative class action lawsuits that were transferred to the United States District Court for the Western District of Missouri for coordinated pre-trial proceedings. The plaintiffs assert claims arising under various state laws for false advertising, consumer protection, deceptive and unfair trade practices, and similar statutes. Their claims are premised on allegations that we have misrepresented the number of servings that can be made from various canisters of Folgers coffee on the packaging for those products. The outcome and the financial impact of these cases, if any, cannot be predicted at this time. Accordingly, no loss contingency has been recorded for these matters as of April 30, 2023, and the likelihood of loss is not considered probable or estimable. However, if we are required to pay significant damages, our business and financial results could be adversely impacted, and sales of those products could suffer not only in these locations but elsewhere. Product Recall: In May 2022, we initiated a voluntary recall of select Jif peanut butter products produced at our Lexington, Kentucky facility and sold primarily in the U.S., due to potential salmonella contamination. At that time, we also suspended the manufacturing of Jif peanut butter products at the Lexington facility and temporarily paused shipments from our Memphis, Tennessee facility to eliminate confusion while customers cleared their shelves of potentially impacted products manufactured at the Lexington facility. No other products produced at our other facilities were affected by the recall. In June 2022, we resumed manufacturing Jif peanut butter products at our Lexington facility, as well as shipping from our Memphis facility. We partnered with retailers to restock Jif peanut butter products during the first quarter of 2023, and as of April 30, 2023, we have returned to normal levels. To date, we have recognized total direct costs associated with the recall of approximately $ 120.0 , net of insurance recoveries, related to customer returns, fees, unsaleable inventory, and other product recall-related costs, primarily within our U.S. Retail Consumer Foods segment. We expect costs associated with the recall to be minimal in 2024. Further, the FDA issued a Warning Letter on January 24, 2023, following an inspection of our Lexington facility completed in June 2022 in connection with the Jif voluntary recall, identifying concerns regarding certain practices and controls at the facility. We have responded to the Warning Letter with a detailed explanation of our food safety plan and extensive verification activities to prevent contamination in Jif peanut butter products. In addition, we have worked diligently to further strengthen our already stringent quality processes, including doubling our finished product testing and tripling our environmental testing to verify the efficacy of our actions. The FDA or other agencies may nonetheless conclude that certain practices or controls were not in compliance with the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act or other laws. Any potential regulatory action based on such an agency conclusion could result in the imposition of injunctive terms and monetary payments that could have a material adverse effect on our business, reputation, brand, results of operations, and financial performance, as well as affect ongoing consumer litigation associated with the voluntary recall of Jif peanut butter products. The outcome and financial impact of the ongoing consumer litigation or any potential regulatory action associated with the Jif voluntary recall cannot be predicted at this time. Accordingly, no loss contingency has been recorded for these matters as of April 30, 2023, and the likelihood of loss is not considered probable or estimable. Note 16: Common Shares Voting: The Amended Articles of Incorporation provide that each holder of a common share outstanding is entitled to one vote on each matter submitted to a vote of the shareholders. Repurchase Programs: During the fourth quarter of 2023, we repurchased approximately 2.4 million common shares for $ 358.0 pursuant to the authorizations of the Board. Under the repurchase plan, a total of approximately 3.5 million common shares remain available for repurchase as of April 30, 2023. In accordance with the Inflation Reduction Act, a one percent excise tax was applied to share repurchases after December 31, 2022. As a result, an excise tax of $ 3.6 was accrued on the repurchased shares during 2023, and included within additional capital in our Consolidated Balance Sheet. A total of 2.0 million common shares were repurchased for $ 262.5 during 2022 under authorizations by the Board, and no excise tax was accrued on the repurchased shares. All other share repurchases during 2023 and 2022 consisted of shares repurchased from stock plan recipients in lieu of cash payments. On March 2, 2023, we also entered into the 10b5-1 Plan that was established in accordance with Rule 10b5-1 of the Exchange Act in connection with the remaining common shares authorized for repurchase by the Board. In accordance with the 10b5-1 Plan, our designated broker has the authority to repurchase approximately 2.4 million commons shares, which commenced on the consummation of the sale of certain pet food brands on April 28, 2023, and will expire 45 calendar days after the closure of the transaction, which is in the first quarter of 2024, unless terminated earlier in accordance with the terms of the 10b5-1 Plan. Subsequent to April 30, 2023, we repurchased approximately 2.4 million common shares for $ 362.8 under this 10b5-1 Plan, and approximately 1.1 million common shares remain available for repurchase. An excise tax of $ 3.6 was also accrued on the repurchased shares during the first quarter of 2024. ']\n"
